WEBVTT

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.080
Tonight, we're putting celebrities under pressure.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.480
in the hope that one of them cracks.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.080
Is it fair on them? No.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.920
Is it fun for me? You betcha.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.960
This is The Weakest Link.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.840
Behind me are eight famous faces

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.240
wondering if this might be the last they ever see of their.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.080
They're each trying to win up to £50,000 for charity -

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.520
but to do that, they'll have to work together.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.400
Seven will leave with nothing,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.200
as round by round, we lose the player voted the weakest link.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.680
Let's meet the team.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.080
I'm Mel B, I'm a Spice Girl, a women's rights campaigner,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.480
and I'm from Leeds.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760
I'm Nick, I play Tony in TV's Hollyoaks and I'm from London.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm Robert, a carpenter expert on the show Sort Your Life Out,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.600
and I'm from north-west London.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.200
I'm Arielle, I'm a DJ and presenter on Radio 1, and.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm Shobna, I'm an actor and an author,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880
and I'm from Lancashire.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.200
I'm Eamonn, I'm a broadcaster, and I'm from Belfast.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.040
I'm from Crieff in Perthshire.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520
I'm Briony, I'm a TV chef and Great British Bake Off

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.480
semifinalist from Bristol.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.320
Fantastic intros, guys, huh?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.960
Feel the energy in the room, huh?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.280
What you're feeling right now is pure buzz.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.440
I'm very excited for you.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.280
OK, here are the rules.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.200
In each round, the aim is to answer enough questions.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.280
to reach your target within the time limit.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.160
The target for round one is £2,500.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.800
The fastest way to get there is to work together

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.280
to create a chain of eight correct answers.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.600
Get your question wrong,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.800
you break the chain

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.920
and you lose all of the money in that chain -

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.560
but if you press your button

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.080
and say bank before the question is asked,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.120
the money is safe and you begin a new chain from scratch.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.520
You've got two minutes and 30 seconds for this round,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400
and we'll start with the person most likely

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.800
to preface whatever part of the country they're in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.920
with the word "sunny".

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.440
That's you, Eamonn Holmes.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.440

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440

Celebrities, I can tell you that you banked £550

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.240
out of a possible £2,500.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.800
That's exactly the reaction that.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.040
LAUGHTER

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.440
If I was still a teacher, I'd give that sort of a C minus

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.160
and tell you to concentrate a bit more.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.120
So, who thinks Prosecco is the.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.440

One of you is about to leave with nothing.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.960
It's time to vote off the weakest link.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.680
Well, at least the team are off the mark

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.440
with some money banked.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.320
There were lots of correct answers in the round,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.080
and the only slip-ups came from Denis and Nick.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.120
How will this first vote play out?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.240
Voting's over.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.480
It's now time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.280
Nick.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.920
Denis.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.280
Denis.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.400
Denis.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.000
Nick.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.360
Sorry, Nick.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.640
Nick.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.960
Denis.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.840
Well, a very tense first round, as they always are.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.080
Nick, how do you feel about how that first round went?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.160
I was just glad it was over.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.040
I didn't want to go first!

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.120
Uh, what made you vote for Denis?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.560
Well, I think it was me or Denis.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.640
We both got a question wrong. I think it was as simple as that.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.240
Yeah. You know, nobody did.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.040
..which is unfortunate in terms of the voting thing -

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.600
and for me, as the host of this,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.640
trying to...trying to get the viewers up.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.440
Um, Denis, Mission: Impossible, not.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.400
Well, I have to confess, it was terrible -

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.280
I look at that photograph and, um...

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.240
I think he's a terrible actor...

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.920
Right.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.360
..and I looked at the photo, and went, "God, he's a terrible.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.480
and I couldn't remember the name of the movie.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.680
Sorry, Tom, love.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.040
Oh, if only the question had been,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.080
"What do you think of Tom Cruise?"

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.680
If only it had been that.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.440
OK, well, as you can tell,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.240
Nick and Denis have received the same number of.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.320
Which means in the event of a tie, it is down to the strongest link

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.120
from that round to decide who actually goes -

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.680
and that is you, Eamonn.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.200
So my question to you is this -

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.480
do you want to stick with who you originally said,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.600
or would you like to change your mind?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.320
No, I will not be changing my mind.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.800
So, sorry, Nick.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.960
Ever since he piloted that X-Wing aircraft in Star Wars,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.120
I've always had a soft spot for Denis.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.240
So, Nick, it's over.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.520
Uh, Nick, you OK?

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.160
Yeah. My mum will be really upset.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.120
Will she?  Yeah.  Aww.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.720
Mine will too. She loves you.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.360
Er, Nick, I'm sorry to say, it's been a delight to have you on,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.160
but with four votes, you are the weakest link.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.480
Goodbye.  Thank you.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.720
I'm feeling a bit sad after being voted the weakest link

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.240
because me mum's a big fan and I wanted to do her proud,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.160
but that's just - that's just how you got to take it,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.080
isn't it, really? There's nothing you can do about it,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.280
and just get the early train home.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.800
Round two.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.640
You've banked £550 out of a possible 2,500.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.000
There's seven of you left,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.440
and we are going to take 10 seconds off the clock.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.440
We're going to start with the strongest link

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.920
from the last round - as we know,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.120
that's you, Eamonn.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.240
Let's play The Weakest Link.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.360
Start the clock.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.480
In Greek mythology, Jason and.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.920
set out on a quest to find the object known as the Golden what?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.400
Fleece.  Correct. Denis.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.760
What word follows Whitby

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.640

It's time to vote off the weakest link.

and, with the most incorrect answers, is the weakest link.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.720
I feel this might be an easier vote for the team.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.800
Voting's over.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.600

Uh, listen, I think it's fair to say it was a tough round,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.960
but I've got faith in this team.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.800

I mean, it's more a plea.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.640
Please!

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.200
Uh, I guess there's a lot to pick from that round -

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.200
what I would do is remind you, as a team,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.600
it is a timed round, and...

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.600
LAUGHTER

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.720

I think scones are morally.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.280
but - but...  What if I made you a nice vegan scone?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.160
Oh, then I'd love it.  OK. I'd love it -

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.720
and then you'd make cream out of liquid

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720
that's been milked out of a chickpea or whatever.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.840
Mm, yeah, yeah.  Shobna.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.360

And I'm sorry to say that you failed.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.240
Why did you vote for Denis?

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.720
Um, Denis took the most time.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.960
Sorry, Denis.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.080
No, it's OK.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.440
Um, Denis, uh, tough round for you.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.480
Well, yeah.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.480
I don't know how I couldn't get the word Abbey out, but there you go.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.400
Yeah.  No, it's not because you hate the Beatles or anything?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.640
No, I don't hate the Beatles.  Yeah.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.640
You're so disappointed that you didn't get the answer,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.240
you actually apologised, which was.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.440
Uh, some others here could learn from that.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.600
Um...

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.600
LAUGHTER

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.960
..but I'm sorry to say, Denis, that with six votes,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.440
you are the weakest link. Goodbye. Thank you.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.640
Well, uh, being the weakest link -

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.680
at least I was the second weakest link.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.160
I fully expected to be the first.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.680
The thing about doing something like this, for me,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.680
is I can remember lines,.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.120
I have a lifetime's experience of doing that -

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.640
but facts, what happened yesterday,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.720

Round three.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.400
You have got £550 out of a possible £5,000 so far.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.920
In this round, we are upping the stakes.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.760
Not only are you down to six players

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.800
with another 10 seconds coming.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.000
but the target is now £5,000.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.640
They're going to start with the strongest link

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.760

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.000
that's you, Eamonn.

Thank goodness.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.680
Lots of correct answers and banking from the team.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.440
Mel B and Eamonn each got a question wrong.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.200
I'm not sure how this vote will go.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.320
Voting's over.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.960
It's now time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.360
Eamonn.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.080
Mel B.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.720
Eamonn.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.440
Mel B.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.200
Mel B.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.760
Eamonn.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.320
Mel B, how are you?

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.920
Oh, really?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.360
Talk to me. Are you...? How are you...?  It's terrifying.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.440
Yeah.  Yeah. Are you finding it horrifying?

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.600
No, I mean... Yeah, I am, actually.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.680
Yeah. OK.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.760
No, thanks for your honesty.  Yeah.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.040
I appreciate it.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.240
Um, is there anything I could do.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.120
Maybe smile? Yeah.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.520
Um...

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.440
How did you feel about the eight-legged goat?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.400
Well, you said mystical.  Yes.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.920
And goats are mystical, to be fair to you.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.720
And I used to own two fainting goats.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.800
Two fainting goats?

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.760
Yeah, so I just gave them a homage.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.280
Yeah. Fainting goats?

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.800
Yeah - but let's focus on the Los Angeles, the one I got right.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.080
OK. Yeah, you did get Los Angeles -

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.120
and that's hard, because how would you have known?

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.800
I mean, you lived there. For 14 years.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.120
Um, Eamonn, how have you found the quizzing experience so far?

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.960
It's really good. I know all the answers to all of the questions.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.280
I just can't remember them, but... LAUGHTER

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.840
..if this was like a multiple choice quiz, that would be...

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.800
I would be fine on it.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.560
Er, now we have another tie on our hands.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.800
Mel B and Eamonn, you've received the same number of.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.640
and as we know now, in the event of a tie,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.880
it's down to the strongest link from that round to decide who goes,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.520
and that is you, Shobna.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.240
Oh!  So, my question to you is this.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.400
Well, I've never been a strongest link.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.040
Well, congratulations!

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.000
Do you want to do an acceptance speech or anything?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.080
No, go for it. Go for it.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.680
Just imagine I've got an.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.000
and I can tell you that the strongest link for that round...

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.920
..was Shobna.  Oh!

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.640
Thank you.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.400
That's my speech.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.080
Er, what are you going to do?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.680
Are you going to stick with who you originally said,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.840
or are you going to change your mind?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.960
I think if you write something, you've got to stick with it.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.240
OK.  So, I'm sticking with Mel B.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.360
Sorry, Mel B.  It's OK.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.960
Mel B, how are you feeling about that?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.600
Well, I mean, I did get one right.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.280
Eamonn got two wrong.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.240
Did I?  Did he?  Did he?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.960
No, he only got one. Well, he took a long time.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.240
I'd like a VAR decision on that.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240
You took a long time to give your answer.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.520
You took up a lot of time. Right, OK.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.240
I mean, the time you took is enough time for a goat to faint twice.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.320
LAUGHTER

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.160
Mel, are you holding any grudges against...?  A lot.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.400
OK, good to know.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.880
Where's the girl power gone?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.240
I - exactly.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.760
I mean, not exactly. I'm impartial, I don't know.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.680
Well, listen, Mel B, obviously, you're a legend,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.480
it's been an honour to have you on the show,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.840
but I'm sorry to say that with three votes,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.520
you are the weakest link. Goodbye.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.640
I'm not leaving.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.720
Oh...

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.840
LAUGHTER

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.520
I think anybody that gets.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.880
feels like a loser weakest link!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.560
Did Shobna make the right decision?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.240
I'm gone, so, obviously, I think not,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.520
but probably she still thinks she did.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.040
But it is what it is.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.880
You can relive that walk of shame and many more

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.360
by pressing the red button

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.000
to take you to other.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.680
Round four. You've banked £1,650.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.360
There are just five of you left,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.000
and we are taking another 10.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.080
off the clock, which means you have two minutes

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.640
to bank a possible £5,000.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.280
We're going to start with the strongest link from the last round -

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.240
as we know, that's you, Shobna.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.800
Thank you. Let's play The Weakest Link.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.960
Start the clock.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.040
In literature, the 1864 Jules.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.960
about the trek made by Axel and his uncle

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.440
is called journey to the centre of the what?

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.480
World.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.320
Er... Earth - I can't accept that. Sorry.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.240
Eamonn, in sport, which cyclist

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.480
who became Britain's most decorated.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.800
announced her retirement in 2024?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.080
Oh...

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.600
Agh!

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.880
This is one of the ones I know, but can't remember.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.240
Sorry, I can't remember.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.640
Laura Kenny. Briony.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.320
In language making, a decision

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.960
between two equally undesirable alternatives

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.480
can be referred to as Hobson's what?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.680
Decision.  Choice.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.280
Robert. What word follows "Polly" in the name of the doll

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.480
that was originally less than.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.240
and goes before "money" in an.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.000

In Western astrology, there are.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.360
12.  Correct.

Shobna. Bank. In nature, during.

plants absorb carbon dioxide and.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.840
Oxygen.  Correct.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.320
Eamonn. In media,

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.520
what B is generally used.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.080
when playing a video caused by a slow or.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.640
What B?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.160
Backlog.  Buffering. Briony.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.960
In celebrities, the 50 Shades.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.560
who is the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson,

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.960
has what first name?

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.680
Dakota. Correct. Robert. Bank. In world.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.120
the Falkland Islands is a British.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.080
in the southern part of which ocean?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.160
Mediterranean.  Atlantic.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.600
Arielle. In numbers,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.080
which of these amounts is smaller,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.040
a score or a baker's dozen?

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.720
A baker's dozen.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.320
Correct. Shobna.  Bank.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.640
In music, in 2024, which Australian born pop star

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.080
was the inaugural winner of.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.800
for Best Pop Dance Recording?

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.000
Kylie Minogue.  Correct.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.320
Eamonn. In history, which number.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.320
was the first to land and allow humans to walk on the moon?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.240
Which Apollo mission?  Correct.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.640
Apollo 11.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.920
Correct.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.360
Time is up.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.640
Celebrities, you banked £400.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.520
So, we did get some money.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.520
You're really scraping to find a.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.320
OK, so who thinks pound sterling is a brother of Raheem?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.160
Who thinks...

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.160
LAUGHTER

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.720
Great. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.560
Who thinks Will Smith is someone who makes wills out of metal?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.400
One of you is about to leave with nothing.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.200
It's time to vote off the weakest link.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.080
That was another toughie, wasn't it?

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.280
The strongest link is now Arielle, getting all her questions right.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.320
Eamonn is now the weakest link, with two wrong answers.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.120
I'd say he's on thin ice.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.240
Voting's over.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.200
It's now time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.240
Sorry, my man. Eamonn.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.880
Eamonn.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.800
Eamonn.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.320
Briony.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.920
Eamonn.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.320
Arielle, what's your general feeling.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.600
Do you find it nerve-racking, or are you pretty chilled?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.160
I'm terrible at them...  Right.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.400
..but I seem to be doing all right today!  You really do.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.920
You've just got a very calm, focused kind of.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.600
I'm actually more terrified of.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.160
than the actual questions.  Oh, yeah.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.400
Well, I'm quite gentle, you know.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.600
It's a friendly roast, you know? A sort of a...  Vegan roast.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.360
Yeah. There you go.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.400
Not as good as a normal one.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.920
Um, why did you vote for Eamonn?

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.040
The last few rounds, he's just taken a lot of time,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.160
and I think that's just as important as giving a wrong answer

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.520
and then moving on.  Mm. So it's mainly about time taking.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.040
Robert, I assume that's the same reason that you voted for.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.760
Yeah, it's the taking too long,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.560
and even after taking longer, we've got a couple of the.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.400
Yes. OK, well, you said it with a smile,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.560
but you really did deliver some.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.440
"Well, it's just that I found his behaviour

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.480
"during that round unacceptable, and..."

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.880
LAUGHTER

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.160
"..he took ages, and he also got the answer wrong

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.200
"and it made me quite angry,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.680
"and I was sort of holding on to quite a lot of rage, Romesh.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.560
"Thank you for asking."

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.560
Um, Eamonn, how are you feeling about these votes?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.480
Oh, fine. I'll take that on the chin.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.720
That's fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.960
I mean, I would say that what slightly did for you

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.680
was one of the questions,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.120
the answer was buffering,

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.080
and that's what you seemed to be doing

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.800
as you were trying to find the answer.  Yeah.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.400
But have you sort of achieved about the level

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.640
that you thought you were going to,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.880
or were you hoping to go all the way?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.600
Oh, no, you would hope to go all the way,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.480
but, you know, it depends the luck of the draw.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.360
Well, Eamonn, I am very sorry to say...

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.960
I'm sure you are!  I am!

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.800
I am very sorry to say that, with four votes,

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.240
you are the weakest link. Goodbye.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.080
The Weakest Link was one of the strongest things I've ever done.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.680
It's a lovely programme, great.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.960
and it's nice to say, "Been there, done it, got the T-shirt."

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.200
Round five.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.000
So far, you have banked a total of £2,050.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.680
We are taking another 10 seconds off the clock,

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.400
and only four of you are remaining -

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.680
but the target is going to increase again to £7,500.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.240
We're going to start with the strongest link

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.320
from the last round. That's you, Arielle.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.600
Me?  Yes, it is you. Yes.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600
Did you want to... Did you want to do a speech or anything?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.000
No. Sorry, I don't, no!

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.440
I've never been the strongest link, ever.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.920
I don't need to do a speech. I was just a bit shocked.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.400
OK, well, listen, good for you,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.480
and maybe it's something you can process later.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.280
Yeah.  Let's play The Weakest Link.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.040
Start the clock.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.800
In transport, which motorway running.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.400

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.280
Star Trek.  Correct.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.720
Briony, what bone in the upper arm has a name

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.400
that sounds like an adjective used to.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.360
Humerus.  Correct. Robert.  Bank.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.600

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.240
Rules.  Deal.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.520
Arielle. In soundtracks, which 1985 film starring Molly Ringwald

Footloose.  Breakfast Club. Shobna.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.120
In astronomy, the structure orbiting.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.240
that took over 40 missions to assemble

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.120

including Amita Dhiri as Milly.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.040
is titled This what?

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.640
Repeat it... Repeat it for me?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.160
The 1990s TV drama about five young lawyers,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.720
including Amita Dhiri as Milly.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.760
is titled This what?

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.000
Oh...

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.480
No. It's gone. No.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.680
Life. Arielle. In animals,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.760

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.440
One.  30.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.400
Briony. Time is up.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.160
Final four, you put in the bank £750 -

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.720
and you did do a lot of banking nothing.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.480
Congrats on that.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.480
We just pressed bank as much as we could.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.760
Yeah, it felt like it had become a real strong habit.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.200
So, who thinks Manhattan is right next to.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.160
Who thinks that Roald Dahl was entirely made of lentils?

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.680
One of you is about to leave with nothing.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.480
It's time to vote off the weakest link.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.760
Oh, wow. That was all over the place -

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.560
but at least some money was banked.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.160
Shobna did well with the most correct answers.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.640
She's the strongest link.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.920
For the first time,

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.520
Robert is the weakest link.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.960
He didn't get any questions right.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.720
Over to the vote.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.960
Voting's over.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.760
It's now time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.640
I love you to bits, but Arielle.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.120
Robert.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.400
Robert.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.320
Robert.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.560
Uh, Shobna. Judas Iscariot.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.080
Quite a cheap guy, in your opinion.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.840
I know!  One piece of silver.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.480
Well, you know, somebody who.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.840
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.520
Doesn't matter how much.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.320
Um, what made you vote for Robert?

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.320
Well, it was just time with Robert, that's all.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.240
It took a lot of time again.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.480
Robert. You did take a bit of time.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.720
I know. I did...

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.960
Bearing in mind that you gave

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.480
that sort of smiling assassin.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.120
of Eamonn taking his time.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.480
I did feel like you sort of -

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.680
I mean, much as I like you, Robert, you did take quite a bit of time

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.640
with some of those questions, didn't you?!  I did, I did.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.800
The answers could not come to me. So...  Yeah.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.400
No - it's difficult. Listen, it's the pressure. I get it.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.320
But you know what? I'm still amazed that I've made it this far, so...

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.160
Well, listen, you've done very, very well.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.600
You've given a great account of yourself.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.960
I think you should be very, very proud -

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.120
but I'm afraid to say, Robert,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.240
that, with three votes,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.800
you are the weakest link. Goodbye.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.280
You get asked the question, then it's like you kind of go blank.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.480
You go in this fog, and in your mind,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.200
you're trying to flick through the pages of a book

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.240
to try and find the answers, and you can't find it.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.960
So that's what makes it so nerve-racking.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.400
It's like nothing I've experienced.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.840
Round six.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.600
You have banked £2,800, and,.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.240
for a show that features Mel B,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.880
girl power - we are down to our final three,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.800
and I'm hoping you're going to bring home a big total.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.880
Another 10 seconds are coming.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.280
and we're going to start with the strongest link

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.280
from the last round - that is you, Shobna.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.560
Oh!  Let's play The Weakest Link.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.720
Start the clock.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.440
In pop music, which '90s group

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.040
that was named after a.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.400

E15.  East 17.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.040
Briony. What word meaning when something is.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.960
sounds like moisture found on grass in the early morning.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.000
Oh...

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.560
Oh, I can't remember. Pass, sorry.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.920
Dew.  Oh.  Arielle.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.040
Look at your screen.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.480
This production is taking place

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.720
in which London theatre?

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.840

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.160

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.440
is called a tuning what?

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.320

without a heel or toe covering are known by what name,

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.400
swingers or sliders?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.400
Sliders.  Correct. Arielle.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.600
Bank.  In current affairs,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.760
Caroline Lucas, Natalie Bennett and.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.640
have all served as leader of which.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.960
Lib Dems.  Green. Shobna.  Bank.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.520
What word follows "street" in a term for outdoor murals and.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.280
and goes before "Garfunkel"

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.880
in the name of a singer who formed a duo with Paul Simon?

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.160
Art.  Correct. Briony.  Bank.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.840
In gaming, 13-year-old Willis Gibson became the first.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.080
to beat the Nintendo version of which.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.840
Um...

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.480
Oh, er, Pac-Man.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.840
Tetris. Arielle.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.320
In history, a group of spies

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.640
that included Kim Philby and.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.440
are commonly referred to by.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.440
Cambridge Five or S Club 7?

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.800
Cambridge Five.  Correct.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.240

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.120
Time is up.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.200
Final three. The top three.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.240
The creme de la creme.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.760
You won £1,250.  Whoo!  Yes!

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.920
Thank goodness for that.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.560
In the next round, not only does the money go up to a possible £10,000,

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.040
but you get the chance to double what you bank,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.480
meaning that the next round is worth a possible £20,000.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.360
So, think very, very carefully.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.760
Who thinks Jake Gyllenhaal

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.160
is just inside the Jake Gyllen front door?

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.600
LAUGHTER

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.960
That was a good one.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.560
Who thinks an Arab sheikh is a Middle Eastern drink?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.280
One of you is about to leave with nothing.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.120
It's time to vote off the weakest link.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.200
Well done, team - a great round.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.200
Remaining as the strongest link is.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.320
Briony has become the weakest link,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.600
with two out of three questions wrong.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.600
Who will make it through at this crucial stage?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.800
Voting's over.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.440
It's now time to reveal who you think is the weakest link.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.440
Briony.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.320
Briony.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.000
Arielle.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.480
Shobna.  Yes.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.200
You've been very, very good across this whole show.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.680
You've done well. Are you pleased with yourself?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.800
Well, I'm surprised.  Mm.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.480
I'm surprised!

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.240
I mean, you also have looked quite frightened the whole time.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.360
Yeah, I am frightened.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.600
I am extremely shy, actually.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.080
Right.  So, it's kind of...

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.320
Yeah, it's a bit... It is a bit shocking.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.440
Um, tough, though.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.800
What made you vote for Briony?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.480
I think she had a few wrong answers.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.560
I'm not sure whether I had the same amount or not, but...I'm not sure.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.240
She seemed hesitant.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.160
Got you. Arielle. Are you pleased?

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.800
I mean, you said you found the whole thing terrifying.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.560
Yeah.  You've got very, very far.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.040
I really lucked out.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.240
There's absolutely no skill to this at all.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.720
OK.  I'm just going to be honest!

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.160
What made you vote for Briony?

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.960
I think, like Shobna said, we all had similar wrong answers,

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.400
but I did know the dew question and Tetris.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.280
So, I was like, "Oh, actually..." Yeah. Fair enough.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.800
Briony, do you feel like you've accepted this.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.080
Once a semifinalist, always a.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.200
So, you know...

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.440
That's all right. I'm OK with it.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.280
Briony, I'm sorry to say, you have been a fantastic.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.080
but, with two votes, you are the weakest link.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.240
Goodbye.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.880
Well, I couldn't stand the heat.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.200
I had to get out the kitchen.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.800
Couldn't even make it to that final.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.600
Really pleased at how far I got,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.880
and didn't feel like I embarrassed myself too much.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.720
Round seven.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.600
So far, you have banked £4,050.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.800
This time you have just 90 seconds -

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.320
but whatever you bank will be doubled,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.000
meaning that this round is worth a possible £20,000.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.240
We're going to start with the strongest link from the last round.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.480
That's you, Shobna.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.560
Oh!  Let's play The Weakest Link.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.720

Perfect.  Nostalgia.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.600
Arielle. Look at your screen.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.320

Time is up, final two.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.120
You put in the bank...

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.920
..£1,250.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.560
We're going to double that and add it to your previous winnings,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.360
meaning a total prize pot of £6,550.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.600
Well done.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.880
But only one of you can take that money away

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.360
for your chosen charity tonight.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.880
It is time to go head-to-head.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.000
In this round, it's the best of five.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.400
Whoever answers the most questions.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.640
Simple as that.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.280
Shobna, as the strongest link in the last round,

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.400
you have the choice of who goes first.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.280
Um... I'll go first.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.440
OK.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.120
For the final time tonight, let's play The Weakest Link.

The correct answer is DAB.

are added together?

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.160
I'm going to say it's 85.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.760
Incorrect. It's 95.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.960
Shobna, in religion, the names.

Incorrect. It's Bash Street -

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.600
which means congratulations, Shobna.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.840
Wow! That was so hard.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.920
You are tonight's strongest link,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.000
and you win £6,550 for charity.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.280
Congratulations.  Thank you.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.960
That was a tough head-to-head.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.440
Well done to both of you.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.000

who provide palliative care

and care for people at home with life-changing illnesses.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.280
A fantastic cause. Well done, Shobna.  Thank you.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.480
Arielle, you leave with nothing.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.000
That's all from tonight's show.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.200
I'm Romesh Ranganathan, and whatever.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.400
Goodbye.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.560
There were two things I was terrified of -

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.640
a roasting from Ramesh

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.360
and the walk of shame and falling over and face planting,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.040
and I managed to avoid both of them.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.720
And also, I was in the presence of a Spice Girl,

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.680
and as someone who is the biggest Spice Girl fan ever,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.720
that is prize enough for me.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.200
To be the winner of The Weakest Link is.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.920
but completely unexpected.

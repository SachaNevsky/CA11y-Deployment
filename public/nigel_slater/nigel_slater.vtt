00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.370
As a cook and writer,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.089
I've long been intrigued by the flavours and fragrances

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.449
of Middle Eastern cooking -

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.609
one of the oldest and most influential cuisines in the world.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.530
Now I want to find out more.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.809
You know, there really is only one true way

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.489
to get to know a region's food, and that's to go there.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.850
To eat the food amongst the people who cook it and eat it every day.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.570
That way, it's seasoned with a sense of place -

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.609
the landscape, the culture and traditions.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.170
That's incredible. So join me on my journey...

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.450
Can I have a look in your cupboard.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.049
..to discover ingredients and recipes that defined three countries

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.729
with truly exciting food stories.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.810
Cheese and roses, it shouldn't work!

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.609
Places considered to be the key pillars of Middle Eastern cuisine.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.369
My adventure takes me across northern Iran

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.650
to taste Persian dishes with a rich heritage,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.409
to Lebanon with its Arab-influenced flavours of the Levant,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.930
and to Turkey, where the recipes born of a diverse landscape

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.650
have travelled the world.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.010
I did a date pattern - I should have done a walnut pattern.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.969
My appetite for new flavours

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.090
takes me through ancient and beguiling lands -

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.010
but, more importantly, into people's homes.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.329
I absolutely loved it, and I can't thank you enough.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.890
This is my chance to learn new techniques and recipes

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.329
that aren't in books

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.810
but have been handed down through generations...

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.129
- How long does it take you?
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes?

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:44.450
Well, I'd better get a move on, then.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
..and I'll share the secrets I'll discover

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.489
by cooking recipes inspired by my journey.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.090
This time, I visit a rapidly changing nation.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.730
From the dishes of Ottoman palaces

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.689
to the rustic home cooking

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.450
at the heart of Turkey.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.810
I start in Istanbul, home to 15 million people -

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.250
today, a rapidly-changing, thriving city

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
that straddles both Europe and Asia.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.569
Formerly Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.169
From here, rich sultans ruled over swathes of Europe,

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.969
Asia and North Africa,

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.050
bringing far-away flavours back to their palace kitchens

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.930
to create the world's most flamboyant food of its time.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:01.169
One of Istanbul's most prestigious hotels was once a sultan's palace.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.930
The grandeur and opulence is clear to see,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.930
echoed not just in its chandeliers and marble,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.129
but also in the classic Ottoman dishes it creates.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.289
At the height of the Empire,

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.370
the finest chefs were summoned from far and wide

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.569
to experiment with ingredients and techniques,

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.849
to engineer dishes fit for the sultan's table.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.210
A whole fish baked in salt would have been a true spectacle.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.930
At the time, salt was a highly prized commodity all over the world.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.370
You...

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.090
This is the sultan showing off.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.930
It's the idea of a silver salver being presented to your guests

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.210
with a huge, whole fish baked in glistening salt.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.330
It's as much show as it is flavour.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.289
It's delicious.
It's delicious...

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.370
..but the point of this dish is about the location.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.410
It's about how glamorous and how beautiful the room is.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.410
It's about the exquisite china.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.569
It's about the way the food is presented.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.170
This is fashionable food.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.089
It's fun and it IS about theatre.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.490
Baklava - the sticky, sweet pastry dessert loved the world over -

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.649
was another dish perfected for the sultan's pleasure.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.410
40 paper-thin layers of filo pastry sandwiched with finely chopped nuts

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.050
and trickled with syrup made each mouthful a work of culinary art.

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.930
Even today, the apprentice bakers must work in the kitchen

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.209
for at least five years before touching the pastry...

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.689
Thank you.

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.050
..and there's also an art to eating it.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.490
You check that it's golden.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490
You put your fork in and then cut right through with a knife.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.529
If you tip it upside down,

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.449
there should not be a drip of syrup that falls off it.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.209
You then dip into your thick clotted yoghurt -

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.610
that's the crust on the top of the yoghurt -

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.449
and then into the ground pistachios...

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.009
..and then you put it into your mouth upside down,

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.050
so that the bottom layer of pastry, which is the most buttery...

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.610
..just touches the roof of your mouth.

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.649
You need a bit of practice to eat it elegantly...

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.850
..but it is very, very good.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.009
It's not sickly and sweet -

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.209
it's nutty and it's flaky and it's light.

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.610
This is lovely.

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.649
While the sultans were eating fine foods from around the world,

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.329
most of the country was enjoying simple home-cooked dishes

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.569
inspired by the produce of its diverse landscape.

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.529
I'm going to a lokanta -

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.170
it's a canteen-style cafe popular all over Turkey

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.569
that serves homely lunches to the urban workforce.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.490
It's also where I'll meet my guide and translator for my journey,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.930
Sibel Samli.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.490
Hey, Nigel.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.050
I'm liking this place.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.689
- Welcome.
- Wow.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.649
Historically, Turkey didn't have much of a restaurant culture...

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.449
..but just over a century ago the lokanta,

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.250
with its domestic recipes and warm-welcome atmosphere,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.129
emerged as an exception...

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:01.970
..and are now one of its most enduring food institutions.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.329
So, tell me, what's going on?

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:08.129
OK, so this is a classic weekday lunch

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.250
for anyone who works and lives in Istanbul.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.889
And do I choose one thing or a couple of things?

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.290
- How does it work?
- Well, Turks usually don't consider a meal a meal

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.610
if it doesn't have meat in it.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.089
I mean, there's a lot of veg, for sure -

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:28.410
green beans, you'll have a lot of potato and meat mixed.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.930
Chickpeas, courgettes, beans.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.730
But then you also have lamb, beef.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.649
This is what I call comfort food.

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:40.769
You know, lots of juices, lots of flavours and juices.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.970
This is slow-cooked food,

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.370
served quickly and without fuss to hungry regulars

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.569
at simple communal tables.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.730
It is very basic, but it's a massive luxury to be able to walk in,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.250
eat fresh, warm food within 30 minutes

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.569
and go back to work.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.290
And reasonably priced, I'm thinking.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.449
- Yes, very.
- Shall we sit down.

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:15.170
The culture of going out at lunchtime for a sandwich -

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.009
- is that here?
- Mm-mm.

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:20.649
I think everyone would be outraged if anyone ever suggested

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.370
that they had to have sandwiches for lunch.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.970
80, 90% of the workforce will break for lunch

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.410
and come to a restaurant like this.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.289
You find variations of it in the poshest neighbourhood

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.129
and the poorest neighbourhood.
They're all...

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:39.649
Cos they'll all cook the same foods.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:42.929
It's kind of an extension of home, in a way.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.929
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.809
This is utterly delicious.

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:48.090
And no sandwiches!

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.769
Food like this every day.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:52.649
Absolutely, it's utterly delicious.

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:55.090
This food is right up my street -

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.169
quality ingredients that don't need to shout or show off,

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.409
but just sit well together.

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:05.529
Simple home cooking with subtle, warm flavours.

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.370
The kind of dish I like to make at home.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.649
Roughly chop an onion

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:17.570
along with an assortment of red and yellow peppers.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.129
Add to a large roasting tin.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.370
Choose a selection of tomatoes

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.929
and add a few sprigs of thyme.

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:28.929
Trickle the mixture with olive oil and then bake.

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:35.289
After 50 minutes, add butter beans, a good pinch of allspice,

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:37.370
and return to the oven for ten minutes.

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:44.649
Briefly boil green beans in salted water and then plunge into cold -

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.169
this keeps their vibrancy.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.330
Fold in the beans at the last minute, so they just warm through,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.649
and then serve.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.970
Simple stews like this are, for me, the true taste of Turkey...

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.210
..born from the fertile soil of its agricultural heartland

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.250
in central Anatolia.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.129
This vast area lies east of Istanbul - Asian Turkey...

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.809
..and it's where my journey continues.

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:20.169
Some believe this is where crop cultivation first began.

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:24.570
Many foods, not just Turkish, can be traced back to Anatolia,

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.529
and the country is one of the few nations in the world

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:31.649
with the diversity and volume of produce to be self-sufficient.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.809
Many of its people still live close to the land,

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:39.049
as they have done for centuries.

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:59.090
It is dawn in the central Anatolian district of Develi,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.330
and the timeless morning routine begins once again.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.970
Songul has left the village just once in her whole life.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.889
THEY SPEAK LOCAL LANGUAGE

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.929
- Nigel, Songul.
- I'm Nigel.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.529
She says there's more in the back room, as well.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.090
They finish this in the summer and then make it again.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.409
This and next door will last for about six months.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.409
This is the store-cupboard version of a thin, unleavened flatbread,

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:51.129
yufka, popular throughout Turkey.

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:52.730
Irresistible.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.570
Once baked, it contains very little water...

00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:59.809
..which means that it can be stored for months

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:02.490
and then rehydrated when needed.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:09.289
Wheat was first cultivated in Turkey around 10,000 years ago,

00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:12.889
and the first breads probably looked a lot like this.

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:14.289
It's like a work of art!

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:15.769
LAUGHTER

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.450
It's just, it's beautiful.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.529
Songul has offered to show me how they make one of their staple meals,

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:25.090
manti.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.169
Manti starts with a simple dough

00:12:29.169 --> 00:12:32.129
made from flour, water, salt and eggs.

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:36.809
While Songul kneads and rolls the dough, her daughter-in-law

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:42.490
makes the filling from minced beef, onions, herbs and ground cumin.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:47.169
It's clear to see that this dish has been made many times.

00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:49.330
These ladies are a dab hand.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.129
Ah, OK, into strips.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.889
So, she's saying, basically,

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:57.730
her older sister lives in Ankara, the capital,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.730
and she's saying that her older sister says that there is a machine

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.330
that does the cutting now, so they should buy that,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.529
and she's saying we're not city slackers,

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:09.570
we're villagers, and we're used to doing it.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.409
And then a little pinch of meat.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.169
How much? In the centre.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.889
The influence of manti on more modern foods like ravioli

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:23.610
is plain to see.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.210
And then like that?

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.769
Can you imagine how long you'd have to wait for dinner

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:30.889
if it was up to me.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.250
It's not long before the topic of conversation veers away

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.690
from the cooking.

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:48.730
So she says she was in love with Songul's son,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.529
but because they thought her father wouldn't allow her to get married

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:58.009
to him, they ran away to Ankara, to the aunt's house,

00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:00.570
and then they stayed there for three days

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.690
until the families agreed on the marriage.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.289
It's pretty common in this village,

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:12.929
because if they're in love, but the family have other plans,

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:14.450
then the girls just run away.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.289
Preparing the food with Songul is a joy.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:28.809
Manti is boiled and its sauce is prepared by grating garlic

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.730
into home-made yoghurt...

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.009
..and a moment for me to find out how Songul feels

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.690
about life here on the Anatolian plateau.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:44.690
This seems quite a hard way of life.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.769
I'm just wondering, would you prefer to work...

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:51.169
..an easier job in the city.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.409
Yeah, it's home.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.009
So, do you think that your children, and particularly your grandson,

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:09.809
do you think that they will take on this way of life afterwards.

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:32.009
The sad thing about that is that maybe this farm wouldn't be here

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:34.850
if it's not passed on to another generation.

00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:38.929
It's all very well for me

00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:42.529
to talk about preserving a traditional way of life -

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.009
making your own yoghurt and your own cheese

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:48.250
and having a cow in the yard...

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.929
..but this is hard.

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:52.009
This is survival.

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:55.210
This is absolutely essential, it's crucial to their lives.

00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:08.330
The hot dumplings are topped with a dollop of the garlicky yoghurt

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.529
and finished with smoked, sweet, crushed red chillies

00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:15.490
warmed in olive oil.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.690
This is amazing.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.730
You know, there is nothing that means more to me...

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:28.490
..than sharing food -

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.289
and the fact that somebody shares their food with me...

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.929
..is everything...

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:37.730
..but also, to share their craft,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.809
their expertise, their knowledge -

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.210
they've also shared their way of life.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.330
It just makes me...

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.009
..just so, so grateful.

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:04.970
My exploration of Anatolian cuisine continues

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.849
50 miles west of Develi in the evocative landscape of Cappadocia...

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:16.609
..peppered with rock-carved homes,

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.329
fascinating rock formations and ancient vineyards.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.369
Once a secret natural wonder,

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.369
this is now a World Heritage site

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.849
and one of Turkey's most popular tourist attractions.

00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:43.410
I'm here to find out more about the classic storeroom staple pekmez,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.450
a grape-based molasses used widely in both sweet and savoury dishes.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.089
So I've come to meet Faruk on his family vineyard.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.890
So, how long have grapes grown on this land.

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:04.650
Thousands of years, these type of grapes are here -

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.450
but this garden, from my grandfather.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.609
This is the most...

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.609
..sweetest one.

00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:13.289
These have all been growing...

00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:16.049
..without giving any water.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.849
Times are changing, and these days Faruk is one of the few locals

00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:32.170
still making his own pekmez.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.569
So, you must have seen quite a lot of change around here.

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:39.890
Yes, for sure.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:46.890
When I was a kid, we had more trees and more greens.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.009
Just like this.
Everywhere was like this.

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:52.690
Nobody is looking after.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.849
Why is nobody looking after it.

00:18:55.849 --> 00:19:00.849
They're running hotels or different kind of tourisms.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.769
More easier for them to make the life like that.

00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:09.490
And the tourism damaging all the land -

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.289
by the ballooning, by the quad bikes, by the hiking.

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:16.250
What do you see as the future,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.210
if you look forward 20 years, 50 years.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.410
I feel very, very sad.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.569
I hitch a lift with Faruk to his home in the village to watch

00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:38.849
the harvested grapes be transformed into pekmez.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.210
This is a special soil we use.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.369
This feels... This feels like flour.

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:01.170
Yes, it is like a flour.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.170
Very, very fine.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:10.170
This volcanic soil, known as marl, is sprinkled on the grapes.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.849
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.569
Now, they're ready to press.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:21.730
No other ingredients are added.

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:27.130
Marl is purely a natural agent used to remove acidity

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.650
and clarify the juice.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.089
You have a lot of fun doing this, don't you?

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:36.250
He's the mayor of the town.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.329
- The mayor?
- He's the mayor of this village, can you believe.

00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.250
I wouldn't get my mayor to do this.

00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:45.170
Over the centuries,

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.970
the methods for its domestic production have barely changed.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.490
So this liquid, it looks milky at the moment because of the stones...

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.609
Because of the stones, yes.

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:58.410
- ..but that will sink to the bottom...
- Yes, in a few hours.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.130
..and then we'll get the clear juice.

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:12.970
Pekmez has a honey-like consistency

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.809
and is made by boiling the juice and reducing it to a thick syrup...

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:22.930
..a process that takes around seven hours.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.970
You know, it's the sounds that make this place as much as anything.

00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:35.730
Sounds that probably haven't changed for hundreds of years.

00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:40.450
The pot of molasses bubbling...

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.410
..the crackling of the fire...

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:47.529
COW MOOS

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:49.089
..the cow, chickens.

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:54.769
Today, the pekmez will be the crowning glory

00:21:54.769 --> 00:21:57.009
of an age-old Anatolian lunch.

00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:00.730
We are having gozleme,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.490
a savoury filling encased in the yufka...

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.210
..the simple flatbread made from just flour and water.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.089
There will be two varieties of gozleme...

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.089
..one filled with spinach and white cheese,

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:20.529
the other with potato and dill.

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:34.970
The yufka wraps are wafer-thin, so only need a short blast of heat.

00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:42.890
Pekmez has been called the healing syrup of Anatolia,

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.490
widely believed to cure everything from colds to anaemia,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.289
because of its high iron and vitamin content.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.730
That's incredible!

00:22:56.569 --> 00:22:59.650
- Incredible.
- Did you ever have something this flavour.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.970
- No, never.
- This is the way...

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.609
The way of living in Anatolia.

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:08.490
It kind of bothers me that it may not continue.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.250
It will continue in the factories, massive,

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.849
which is not the same thing.

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:22.490
Faruk's Anatolia is changing fast.

00:23:24.089 --> 00:23:28.170
The regional capital Kayseri is home to thriving industries

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.930
set up to feed Turkey's booming economy.

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:36.529
130 factories opened here in a single day,

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:40.650
and since the '90s, its population has doubled to almost a million...

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.089
..many of them leaving their rural homes in favour of urban life.

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:52.329
It's just one of many examples of the growth of new cities

00:23:52.329 --> 00:23:54.529
right the way across Anatolia...

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:57.490
..and this is the dilemma that Turkey faces -

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.049
modernity...

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.130
..without losing their traditions,

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.369
without losing the flavour of the land.

00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:16.369
Turkey is an enormously diverse country.

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:18.569
There are seven distinct regions,

00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:21.250
with every climate imaginable,

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.289
from the torrid conditions of the Anatolian plateau

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:27.849
to the misty green mountains of the eastern Black Sea.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.609
The benefit of such a diverse climate

00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:34.849
is the wealth of regional variation in the food.

00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:40.490
I've come to the Trabzon region of the Black Sea,

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.369
to the town of the same name,

00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:46.529
to taste a bread-based dish that is eaten all over Turkey,

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:50.130
but here is made with a very special local flourish.

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:53.809
Hello.

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:55.049
SHE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.730
Pide, please.

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:04.289
Pide is normally made as a boat-shaped leavened bread

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:06.089
with a variety of toppings...

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:12.730
..from dried beef or minced lamb to spinach -

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.769
but in this case...

00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:19.210
..it's cheese.
There's no olives grown around here - or not many.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.890
This is a dairy culture.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.609
While sheep and goat's cheese is very popular in Turkey,

00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:29.690
in the Black Sea region, only their local cows' kolof will do.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.690
Just in case that's not enough dairy...

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.289
It's going to be good.

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:34.609
..a generous scoop

00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:39.250
of the region's iconic, deep yellow highland butter is also added.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.130
The locals say that without butter, there is no taste -

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.730
and they are certainly not taking any chances here.

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:51.329
Ah!

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.730
I've never seen anything like this in my life.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.130
It's almost like a fondue.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.690
It's like cheese soup held within a crust...

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.210
..and it squeaks.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.210
There's a special local way to cut this -

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.769
carefully remove the top of the crust.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.210
Break it into pieces

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.529
and then dip it into the molten cheese.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:30.170
Mm!
It's kind of like the pizza you always want but never quite get.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.210
This is the food that the word "gorgeous" was invented for.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.009
It's the only way to describe it...

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.690
..and I will gorge.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.289
Pide fillings can be as varied as you like,

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:45.529
and the dough is really simple to make.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.650
Mix 450g of flour with seven grams of dried yeast.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.569
A pinch of salt, and 350ml of water.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.450
Knead, and leave to rise for an hour.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.490
Roll out and shape the dough.

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:13.450
For my filling, I'm grating a handful of Turkish cheese,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.329
thinly slicing tomatoes,

00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:18.569
and sujuk, a Turkish sausage.

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:22.369
Trickle with olive oil...

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.210
..then bake for 20 minutes.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.089
The final dish is truly comforting.

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:44.450
The landscape around Trabzon is well suited to dairy farming,

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.089
and much of it is carried out in the traditional way of moving the herds

00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:52.089
between the highlands and lowlands with the seasons.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.809
With winter fast approaching,

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:59.369
I'm keen to see the mountain pastures

00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:01.450
before the roads become impassable.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.490
The view is fast disappearing.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.970
One minute it's snow-capped mountains,

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.849
and the next minute it is thick and very eerie mist.

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:23.049
This is one of the many summer villages

00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:27.410
which serve as seasonal dwellings for the local herders.

00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:32.410
So, we are over 2,000 metres high,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.809
and the village is deserted.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.250
The winter crocuses are starting to come out,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.009
which is a sign for the herdsmen to take their cattle down

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:45.210
from the lush mountain pasture down into the valley.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.250
The snows are well and truly on their way.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.650
Whilst dairy is what this area is traditionally associated with,

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.450
the last 100 years has seen a new industry flourish

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.410
in the rainy fertile foothills of the mountains.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.650
Tea in Turkey is big business,

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.769
and locally, in the Rize province an hour's drive east of Trabzon,

00:29:20.769 --> 00:29:24.730
it's so important even the local football team is named after it.

00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:30.450
The misty foothills of the Black Sea mountains

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.210
are home to over 200,000 independent tea gardens,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.890
who supplied Turkey's insatiable thirst for a good brew.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.289
The further I head into the mountains,

00:29:41.289 --> 00:29:46.849
the more I can see how absolutely crucial tea growing is to this area.

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:48.970
You can almost smell it.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.210
Any tiny little space on the slopes of the hillside,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.609
there's a row of tea bushes.

00:29:58.089 --> 00:30:02.049
I've been invited to take part in a tea harvest.

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:03.450
It's an early start,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.849
so bed and breakfast are part of the deal.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.890
Sibel introduces me to brother and sister Lale and Gokhan.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:18.769
They are Hemshin, a minority group of Armenian descent.

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:21.410
They still live in their family home,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.970
which I'm told has a bit of a story all of its own.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.650
How long have you lived here?

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.650
Do you know how old the house is.

00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:39.130
OK.

00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:41.970
Deliciously creaky.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.529
And that's their mother.

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.730
So, it was their grandfather that made this house from scratch -

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.410
but he never got to live in it

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.690
because he died very young in Poland.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.769
He was shot during the First World War.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.690
The hand prints are from when they sacrificed an animal

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:25.130
to bless the house when the last foundations were put in place.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.450
Gosh, sacrificing an animal.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.690
All I did was open a bottle of wine when I moved in.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.809
Gosh.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.930
After a sound night's sleep, it's time to pick some tea.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.020
Another of Turkey's essential dried staples is rice...

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.300
..and pilaf is a favourite national dish.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.420
First, wash the rice three times to remove any excess starch.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.060
Sizzle butter in a pan.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.180
Add four tablespoons of orzo...

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.180
..and 250g of baldo Turkish rice.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.300
Add chicken stock.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.180
Bring to the boil, and then simmer for ten minutes.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.420
My pilaf uses half a kilo of fresh mussels.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.060
Cover the pan and steam for five minutes.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.180
Chop a handful of dill and then add it to the pan.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.620
Fork the rice and serve in a bowl.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.180
The rice base can be home to many fillings,

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.580
but my next trip is to try one that is new to me.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.860
So, before I head home, there is one last stop I want to make

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.020
on the shores of the Black Sea.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.980
I've come to Hopa, which is a few kilometres from the Georgian border,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.100
because this is the beginning of a very special season.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.300
It's the short season for hamsi,

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.580
the tiny little fish that are very, very valued -

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.740
and tonight we'll be cooking them and celebrating the season.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.020
The hamsi is a Black Sea anchovy

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.380
and is celebrated in Turkey as the prince of fish.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.500
For the Laz community who live here,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.820
a strong culture has grown out of this short but abundant season.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.500
It is said that they never run out of ways to cook hamsi,

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.340
even including it in a dessert...

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.980
..but, in recent years, commercial fishing trawlers have muscled in,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.060
threatening the livelihoods of these local fishermen.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.380
A fishing boat leaves the harbour in search of its daily catch.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.980
I'm helping Tuna in the kitchen to make hamsi pilaf...

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.980
..the centrepiece of their celebrations for centuries.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.100
The fish used in this dish have been brought from the commercial catch

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.700
sold at the local market.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.300
A clear indication of just how much

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.980
the local fishing economy has changed.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.580
Covering the whole base of the baking tin

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.260
with the little filleted anchovies, and...

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.820
Which is quite tricky because they're very slippy.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.980
Other people's kitchens, they are a delight to cook in

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.420
but they're also ever so slightly scary.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.300
Especially when you're cooking recipes

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.540
that they've done all their life, and you're doing for the first time.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.780
The rice is added to the softened onions and coated in oil...

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.260
..and now welcomes the other ingredients -

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.900
tomato paste, chilli powder,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.380
dried mint and flour from locally-milled corn.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.140
While we prepare the salad to go with it,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.420
Tuna recalls childhood days before the trawlers came.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.660
SHE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.460
When we were kids...

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.220
..we used to be able to come down to the shore and collect them

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.860
in our T-shirts, you know...

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.140
- Really?
That many?
- Yeah, catching them in my hand, there were so many,

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.260
- but not any more.
- So, where have they gone?

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.100
Basically it's because these big ships are now using radar systems

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.260
to find where the fish are, so they collect all of them in one go.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.220
It's not that there aren't any fish,

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.740
but for us little boats, there's not much left,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.260
so then we get very little left over, you know.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.380
It's luck.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.700
The dish is assembled and ready for the oven.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.060
That smells good.
It smells fantastic.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.900
Just smell that dried mint and that little bit of chilli

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.300
that is in the rice.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.020
Like that?

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.620
And now, just some all-important finishing touches.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.380
Beautiful!

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.220
Gorgeous.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.460
No, thank you.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.340
It's evening, and the boat arrives back...

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.060
..empty-handed...

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.420
..but this small detail isn't going to stop the party.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.300
We need two people downstairs.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.820
There's more than a little chaos here.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.300
We decided we need an extra table, so it couldn't go down the stairs,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.100
so it came through the window -

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.740
but then, for some reason, everything else -

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.180
glasses, plates, tablecloth, chairs,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.580
and most of the food - has come out of the window

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.860
with us all stretching up and grabbing it best we can.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.460
I'm not quite sure why we didn't just use the stairs.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.860
The feast is laid out,

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.180
with its magnificent centrepiece, the hamsi pilaf.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.020
The party has started.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.860
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.660
More rice.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.540
- This is the dish. 
- I would love some, thank you.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.340
- THE dish.
- THE dish.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.180
Mmm!

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.860
So, this is how the Laz party.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.100
What I really love is the way that as someone else comes to the table,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.900
you just all shove along and shove along -

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.980
and you started with six,

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.580
and at some point you're going to be sat on each other's laps.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.300
- You never say no to a guest. 
- Exactly.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.820
The hamsi were always key to survival in winter months,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.780
and the fishermen try to hasten their arrival

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.780
through a special dance called the horon,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.300
said to be inspired by the wriggling fish in the nets.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.300
These traditions, this dance, this language,

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.780
is specific to this tiny community -

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.580
and I was asking Sibel, who has accompanied me throughout this trip,

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.060
why she didn't know the words, and she said,

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.900
because this is a language that even she didn't speak.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.980
It's of a tiny little community.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.660
A community that is staying together

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.460
and singing together and eating together.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.260
They fish, that's what they do, their lives are about fish.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.620
They are about the coast.
This is where they've been for years

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.220
and this is where they belong...

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.660
..and they are going to preserve this

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.260
for as long as they possibly can.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.340
The apparent depletion of the hamsi stock

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.180
lends a bittersweet edge to these celebrations...

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.860
..but the spirit of the people

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.900
and the pride in their culture is contagious.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.260
Turkey is immense.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.500
I thought I knew it.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.340
I thought I knew the country and its food.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.580
I couldn't have been more wrong.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.380
This is a mosaic of unique territories,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.900
each with their own heritage.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.820
I started this journey tasting the food of the sultans

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.540
with its opulence and its extravagance.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.020
That was a little bit of a red herring,

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.460
because the real soul of the food here

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.420
is to be found in rural areas.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.980
It's different communities living quite closely

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.580
but very, very different.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.460
It's about preserving their traditions, their way of life.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.860
Even their languages.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.300
It's also about preserving your food,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.620
whether it's fish, whether it's dairy produce,

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.420
whether it's fruit and vegetables -

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.980
but enjoying them when they are here,

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.020
and, then, clever ways of keeping them for the winter,

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.340
for the dark days when there's very little else.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.500
This is a truly different Turkey from the one I thought I'd see

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.180
when I got off that plane.

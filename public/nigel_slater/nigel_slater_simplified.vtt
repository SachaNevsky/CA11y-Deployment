00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.370
As a cook and writer,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.089
I have long liked the tastes and smells

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.449
of Middle Eastern food. 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.609
It is one of the oldest and most important ways of cooking in the world. 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.530
Now I want to learn more. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.809
You know, there is only one true way

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.489
to learn about a place's food, and that is to go there. 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.850
To eat the food with the people who cook it and eat it each day. 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.570
That way, it tastes like the place. 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.609
You can taste the land, the way they live, and old ways. 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.170
That is so good. So come with me on my trip. 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.450
Can I look in your cupboard? 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.049
We will find foods and ways to cook that show what three lands

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.729
with fun food stories are like. 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.810
Cheese and roses, it should not work! 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.609
These places are seen as the main parts of Middle Eastern food. 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.369
My trip takes me across North Iran

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.650
to taste Persian foods with a long past. 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.409
Then to Lebanon with its Arab tastes from the Levant. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.930
And to Turkey, where ways to cook from many kinds of land

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.650
have gone all over the world. 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.010
I made a date shape - I should have made a walnut shape. 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.969
I want to find new tastes. 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.090
This takes me through old and pretty lands. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.010
But, more key, into people's homes. 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.329
I loved it so much, and I thank you very much. 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.890
This is my chance to learn new ways to cook and new dishes

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.329
that are not in books. 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.810
But have been passed down for many years. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.129
How long does it take you? 

Five minutes.
Five minutes?

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:44.450
Well, I should hurry up then. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
And I will share the secrets I find

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.489
by cooking foods that my trip made me think of. 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.090
This time, I go to a land that is changing fast. 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.730
From the foods of Ottoman kings' homes

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.689
to the plain home cooking

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.450
at the heart of Turkey. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.810
I start in Istanbul, where 15 million people live. 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.250
Today, it is a city that changes fast and does well. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
It sits in both Europe and Asia. 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.569
It used to be called Constantinople, the center of the Ottoman rule. 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.169
From here, rich kings ruled over big parts of Europe,

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.969
Asia, and North Africa. 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.050
They brought tastes from far lands back to their palace kitchens 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.930
to make the world's most fancy food of that time. 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:01.169
One of Istanbul's best hotels was once a king's palace. 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.930
You can see how grand and rich it is. 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.930
You can see it not just in its lights and stone,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.129
but also in the old Ottoman foods it makes. 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.289
When the Empire was at its best,

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.370
the best cooks were called from far places 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.569
to try new foods and ways to cook, 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.849
to make foods good enough for the king's table. 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.210
A whole fish baked in salt would have been a real show. 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.930
At that time, salt was a very special thing all over the world. 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.370
You...

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.090
This is the king showing off. 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.930
It is the idea of a silver plate being shown to your guests 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.210
with a big, whole fish baked in shiny salt. 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.330
It is as much about show as it is about taste. 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.289
It is so good. 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.370
It is so good...
but the point of this food is the place. 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.410
It is about how fancy and how nice the room is. 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.410
It is about the very nice plates. 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.569
It is about how the food is shown. 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.170
This is fancy food. 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.089
It is fun and it IS about a show. 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.490
Baklava - the sticky, sweet cake loved all over the world - 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.649
was one more food made perfect for the king to enjoy. 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.410
40 very thin layers of pastry put with small cut nuts 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.050
and sweet syrup on top made each bite a food art piece. 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.930
Even now, the new bakers must work in the kitchen 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.209
for at least five years before they can touch the pastry. 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.689
Thank you. 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.050
And there is also an art to eating it. 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.490
You check that it is gold. 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490
You put your fork in and then cut all the way with a knife. 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.529
If you turn it upside down, 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.449
no drop of syrup should fall off it. 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.209
Then you dip it into your thick, rich yogurt. 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.610
That is the crust on the top of the yogurt. 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.449
And then into the ground nut pieces. 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.009
And then you put it in your mouth upside down, 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.050
so that the last layer of pastry, which has the most butter... 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.610
just touches the top of your mouth. 

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.649
You need to try a bit to eat it well. 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.850
But it is very, very good. 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.009
It is not too much sweet. 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.209
It has nuts and is flaky and light. 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.610
This is lovely. 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.649
While the kings were eating fine foods from all over the world, 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.329
most of the land was eating plain home-cooked foods 

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.569
made with things from its many kinds of land. 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.529
I am going to a lokanta. 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.170
It is a cafe like a lunch room, liked all over Turkey. 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.569
It gives home-style lunches to people who work in the city. 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.490
It is also where I will meet my helper and talker for my trip, 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.930
Sibel Samli. 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.490
Hey, Nigel. 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.050
I am liking this place. 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.689
Welcome. 
Wow.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.649
A long time ago, Turkey did not have many food places. 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.449
But just over 100 years ago, the lokanta, 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.250
with its home recipes and warm, nice feel, 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.129
came out as one new kind. 

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:01.970
And are now one of its food places that has stayed the longest. 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.329
So, tell me, what is here? 

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:08.129
OK, so this is a normal weekday lunch 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.250
for anyone who works and lives in Istanbul. 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.889
And do I pick one thing or a few things? 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.290
How does it work? 
Well, Turks usually do not think a meal is a meal

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.610
if it does not have meat in it. 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.089
I mean, there are a lot of greens, for sure. 

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:28.410
Green beans, you will have a lot of potato and meat mixed. 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.930
Peas, green squash, beans. 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.730
But then you also have lamb, beef. 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.649
This is what I call comfort food. 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:40.769
You know, lots of juices, lots of tastes and juices. 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.970
This is food cooked for a long time, 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.370
given fast and with no fuss to hungry people who come often 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.569
at plain tables shared with others. 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.730
It is very plain, but it is a very nice thing to be able to walk in, 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.250
eat fresh, warm food in 30 minutes 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.569
and go back to work. 

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.290
And not too much money, I think. 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.449
Yes, very. 
Shall we sit down.

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:15.170
The way of going out at lunch for a sandwich - 

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.009
is that here? 
Mm-mm.

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:20.649
I think everyone would be very mad if anyone ever said 

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.370
that they had to have sandwiches for lunch. 

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.970
Most workers will stop for lunch 

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.410
and come to a food place like this. 

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.289
You find kinds of it in the most fancy area 

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.129
and the most poor area. 

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:39.649
They are all...
Because they will all cook the same foods. 

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:42.929
It is kind of like a part of home, in a way. 

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.929
Yes, yes. 

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.809
This is so, so good. 

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:48.090
And no sandwiches! 

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.769
Food like this each day. 

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:52.649
Yes, it is so, so good. 

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:55.090
This food is just what I like. 

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.169
Good foods that do not need to be loud or show off, 

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.409
but just go well together. 

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:05.529
Plain home cooking with soft, warm tastes. 

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.370
The kind of food I like to make at home. 

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.649
Cut an onion into rough bits 

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:17.570
with some red and yellow peppers. 

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.129
Add to a big baking pan. 

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.370
Pick some tomatoes 

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.929
and add a few bits of thyme. 

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:28.929
Put olive oil on the mix and then bake. 

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:35.289
After 50 minutes, add butter beans, a good bit of allspice, 

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:37.370
and put back in the oven for ten minutes. 

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:44.649
Quickly boil green beans in salt water and then put in cold water. 

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.169
This keeps them bright. 

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.330
Mix in the beans at the last minute, so they just get warm, 

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.649
and then serve. 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.970
Plain stews like this are, for me, the real taste of Turkey. 

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.730

00:09:09.730 --> 01:00:04.210
They come from the good soil of its farm land 

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.250
in middle Anatolia. 

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.129
This big area is east of Istanbul - Asian Turkey. 

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.809
And it is where my trip goes on. 

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:20.169
Some think this is where growing plants first started. 

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:24.570
Many foods, not just Turkish, can be from Anatolia. 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.529
And the land is one of few in the world 

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:31.649
with enough different kinds and amounts of food to feed itself. 

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.809
Many of its people still live near the land, 

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:39.049
as they have for hundreds of years. 

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:59.090
It is early morning in the Develi area of middle Anatolia, 

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.330
and the old morning work starts once more. 

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.970
Songul has left the town only one time in her whole life. 

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.889
THEY SPEAK THEIR OWN WORDS

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.929
Nigel, Songul. 
I am Nigel.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.529
She says there is more in the back room, too. 

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.090
They finish this in the summer and then make it again. 

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.409
This and next door will last for about six months. 

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.409
This is the kept kind of a thin, flat bread with no yeast, 

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:51.129
yufka, liked all through Turkey. 
It is hard to not eat. 

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:52.730
Once baked, it has very little water. 

00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:59.809
This means that it can be kept for months 

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:02.490
and then made wet again when it is needed. 

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:09.289
Wheat was first grown in Turkey about 10,000 years ago. 

00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:12.889
And the first breads most likely looked a lot like this. 

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:14.289
It is like a piece of art! 

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:15.769
LAUGHING

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.450
It is just, it is pretty. 

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.529
Songul has said she will show me how they make one of their main foods, 

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:25.090
manti. 

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.169
Manti starts with a plain dough 

00:12:29.169 --> 00:12:32.129
made from flour, water, salt and eggs. 

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:36.809
While Songul mixes and rolls the dough, her son's wife 

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:42.490
makes the inside part from ground beef, onions, plants and ground cumin. 

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:47.169
It is easy to see that this food has been made many times. 

00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:49.330
These ladies are very good at it. 

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.129
Ah, OK, into long bits. 

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.889
So, she is saying, mostly, 

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:57.730
her older sister lives in Ankara, the main city, 

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.730
and she is saying that her older sister says that there is a machine 

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.330
that cuts now, so they should buy that, 

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.529
and she is saying we are not lazy city people, 

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:09.570
we are town people, and we are used to doing it. 

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.409
And then a little bit of meat. 

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.169
How much? In the middle. 

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.889
How manti made new foods like ravioli 

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:23.610
is easy to see. 

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.210
And then like that? 

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.769
Can you think how long you would have to wait for food 

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:30.889
if I made it. 

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.250
It is not long before the talk turns away 

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.690
from the cooking. 

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:48.730
So she says she was in love with Songul's son, 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.529
but because they thought her dad would not let her get married 

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:58.009
to him, they ran away to Ankara, to the aunt's house, 

00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:00.570
and then they stayed there for three days 

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.690
until the groups agreed on the wedding. 

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.289
It happens a lot in this town, 

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:12.929
because if they are in love, but the family has other plans, 

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:14.450
then the girls just run away. 

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.289
Making the food with Songul is fun. 

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:28.809
Manti is boiled and its sauce is made by grating garlic 

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.730
into home-made yogurt. 

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.009
And a time for me to find out how Songul feels 

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.690
about life here on the Anatolian flat land. 

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:44.690
This seems like a hard way to live. 

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.769
I am just asking, would you like to work... 

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:51.169
an easier job in the city. 

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.409
Yes, it is home. 

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.009
So, do you think that your kids, and your grandson too, 

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:09.809
do you think that they will live this way later. 

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:32.009
The sad thing about that is that maybe this farm would not be here 

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:34.850
if it is not given to new young people. 

00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:38.929
It is easy for me 

00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:42.529
to talk about keeping an old way of life. 

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.009
Making your own yogurt and your own cheese 

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:48.250
and having a cow in the yard. 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.929
But this is hard. 

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:52.009
This is staying alive. 

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:55.210
This is very, very needed for their lives. 

00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:08.330
The hot food bits are topped with some of the garlic yogurt 

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.529
and then smoked, sweet, crushed red peppers 

00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:15.490
warmed in olive oil. 

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.690
This is so good. 

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.730
You know, there is nothing that means more to me... 

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:28.490
than sharing food. 

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.289
And that someone shares their food with me... 

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.929
is everything. 

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:37.730
But also, to share their skill, 

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.809
their smarts, what they know. 

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.210
They have also shared their way of life. 

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.330
It just makes me... 

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.009
just so, so happy. 

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:04.970
My looking into Anatolian food goes on 

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.849
50 miles west of Develi in the cool land of Cappadocia. 

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:16.609
It has homes cut in rock, 

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.329
fun rock shapes and old grape fields. 

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.369
Once a hidden nice place in nature, 

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.369
this is now a World Old Place site 

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.849
and one of Turkey's most liked spots for people to visit. 

00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:43.410
I am here to learn more about the old store food pekmez, 

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.450
a grape sweet stuff used a lot in both sweet and not sweet foods. 

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.089
So I have come to meet Faruk at his family grape field. 

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.890
So, how long have grapes grown on this land? 

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:04.650
Many, many years, these kinds of grapes are here. 

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.450
But this garden, from my grandpa. 

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.609
This is the most... 

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.609
sweetest one. 

00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:13.289
These have all been growing... 

00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:16.049
without giving any water. 

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.849
Times are changing, and these days Faruk is one of few local people 

00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:32.170
still making his own pekmez. 

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.569
So, you must have seen a lot of change around here. 

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:39.890
Yes, for sure. 

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:46.890
When I was a kid, we had more trees and more green things. 

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.009
Just like this. 
All places were like this. 

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:52.690
No one is looking after it. 

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.849
Why is no one looking after it? 

00:18:55.849 --> 00:19:00.849
They are running hotels or different kinds of visit places. 

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.769
It is more easy for them to make life like that. 

00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:09.490
And the people visiting are hurting all the land. 

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.289
By the balloons, by the small cars, by the walking. 

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:16.250
What do you see in the future, 

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.210
if you look 20 years, 50 years from now? 

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.410
I feel very, very sad. 

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.569
I get a ride with Faruk to his home in the town to watch 

00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:38.849
the picked grapes be made into pekmez. 

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.210
This is a special dirt we use. 

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.369
This feels... This feels like flour. 

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:01.170
Yes, it is like a flour. 

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.170
Very, very fine. 

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:10.170
This volcano dirt, called marl, is put on the grapes. 

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.849
HE SPEAKS HIS OWN WORDS

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.569
Now, they are ready to press. 

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:21.730
No other things are added. 

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:27.130
Marl is just a nature thing used to take out sourness 

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.650
and make the juice clear. 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.089
You have a lot of fun doing this, do you not? 

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:36.250
He is the boss of the town. 

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.329
The boss? 

He is the boss of this town, can you think?

00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.250
I would not get my boss to do this. 

00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:45.170
Over many years, 

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.970
the ways for making it at home have not changed much. 

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.490
So this liquid, it looks white now because of the stones. 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.609
Because of the stones, yes. 

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:58.410
But that will go to the bottom. 

Yes, in a few hours.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.130
And then we will get the clear juice. 

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:12.970
Pekmez is thick like honey 

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.809
and is made by boiling the juice and making it a thick syrup. 

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:22.930
This takes about seven hours. 

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.970
You know, it is the sounds that make this place as much as anything. 

00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:35.730
Sounds that most likely have not changed for hundreds of years. 

00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:40.450
The pot of sweet stuff bubbling. 

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.410
The sound of the fire. 

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:47.529
COW MOOS

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:49.089
The cow, chickens. 

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:54.769
Today, the pekmez will be the best part 

00:21:54.769 --> 00:21:57.009
of an old Anatolian lunch. 

00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:00.730
We are having gozleme, 

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.490
a filling that is not sweet inside the yufka. 

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.210
The plain flat bread made from just flour and water. 

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.089
There will be two kinds of gozleme. 

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.089
One filled with spinach and white cheese, 

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:20.529
the other with potato and dill. 

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:34.970
The yufka wraps are paper thin, so they only need a short time on heat. 

00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:42.890
Pekmez has been called the healing syrup of Anatolia. 

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.490
Many think it cures all from colds to not enough iron, 

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.289
because it has a lot of iron and good things. 

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.730
That is so good! 

00:22:56.569 --> 00:22:59.650
So good. 

Did you ever have something this taste?

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.970
No, never. 
This is the way...

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.609
The way of living in Anatolia. 

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:08.490
It kind of makes me sad that it may not go on. 

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.250
It will go on in big places, big, 

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.849
which is not the same thing. 

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:22.490
Faruk's Anatolia is changing fast. 

00:23:24.089 --> 00:23:28.170
The main city of the area, Kayseri, has many work places that do well 

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.930
set up to feed Turkey's growing money. 

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:36.529
130 work places opened here in one day, 

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:40.650
and since the 1990s, its people have grown to almost a million. 

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.089
Many of them leaving their country homes for city life. 

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:52.329
It is just one of many new cities growing 

00:23:52.329 --> 00:23:54.529
all across Anatolia. 

00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:57.490
And this is the hard choice that Turkey has. 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.049
New ways... 

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.130
without losing their old ways, 

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.369
without losing the taste of the land. 

00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:16.369
Turkey is a very big and different land. 

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:18.569
There are seven different parts, 

00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:21.250
with all kinds of weather you can think of, 

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.289
from the very hot parts of the Anatolian flat land 

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:27.849
to the wet green hills of the east Black Sea. 

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.609
The good thing about such different weather 

00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:34.849
is the many different kinds of food in each part. 

00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:40.490
I have come to the Trabzon part of the Black Sea, 

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.369
to the town with the same name, 

00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:46.529
to taste a bread food that is eaten all over Turkey, 

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:50.130
but here it is made with a very special local way. 

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:53.809
Hello. 

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:55.049
SHE SPEAKS HER OWN WORDS

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.730
Pide, please. 

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:04.289
Pide is normally made as a boat-shaped bread with yeast 

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:06.089
with different things on top. 

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:12.730
From dried beef or ground lamb to spinach. 

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.769
But in this case... 

00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:19.210
it is cheese.
There are no olives grown around here - or not many. 

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.890
This is a milk food place. 

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.609
While sheep and goat cheese is very liked in Turkey, 

00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:29.690
in the Black Sea part, only their local cows' kolof is used. 

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.690
Just in case that is not enough milk food... 

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.289
It is going to be good. 

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:34.609
A lot 

00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:39.250
of the area's known deep yellow hill butter is also added. 

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.130
The local people say that without butter, there is no taste. 

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.730
And they are for sure not taking any chances here. 

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:51.329
Ah! 

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.730
I have never seen anything like this in my life. 

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.130
It is almost like a cheese dip. 

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.690
It is like cheese soup held in a crust. 

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.210
And it squeaks. 

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.210
There is a special local way to cut this. 

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.769
Carefully take off the top of the crust. 

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.210
Break it into bits 

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.529
and then dip it into the melted cheese. 

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:30.170
Mm!
It is kind of like the pizza you always want but do not quite get. 

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.210
This is the food that the word "great" was made for. 

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.009
It is the only way to say it. 

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.690
And I will eat a lot. 

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.289
Pide fillings can be as different as you like, 

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:45.529
and the dough is very easy to make. 

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.650
Mix 450g of flour with seven grams of dry yeast. 

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.569
A bit of salt, and 350ml of water. 

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.450
Knead it, and let it sit for an hour. 

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.490
Roll out and shape the dough. 

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:13.450
For my filling, I am grating some Turkish cheese, 

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.329
cutting tomatoes thin, 

00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:18.569
and sujuk, a Turkish meat. 

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:22.369
Put olive oil on it. 

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.210
Then bake for 20 minutes. 

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.089
The last dish is very comforting. 

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:44.450
The land around Trabzon is good for milk farms, 

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.089
and much of it is done the old way of moving the cows 

00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:52.089
between the high lands and low lands with the times of year. 

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.809
With winter coming fast, 

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:59.369
I want to see the hill fields 

00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:01.450
before the roads cannot be used. 

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.490
The view is going away fast. 

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.970
One minute it is hills with snow, 

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.849
and the next minute it is thick and very strange mist. 

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:23.049
This is one of the many summer towns 

00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:27.410
which are homes for a time for the local cow keepers. 

00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:32.410
So, we are over 2,000 metres high, 

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.809
and the town is empty. 

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.250
The winter flowers are starting to come out, 

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.009
which is a sign for the cow men to take their cows down 

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:45.210
from the green hill field down into the low land. 

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.250
The snows are really on their way. 

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.650
While milk food is what this area is known for from old times, 

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.450
the last 100 years has seen a new work do well 

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.410
in the rainy good low hills of the mountains. 

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.650
Tea in Turkey is big work, 

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.769
and near here, in the Rize part an hour's drive east of Trabzon, 

00:29:20.769 --> 00:29:24.730
it is so key even the local ball team is named after it. 

00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:30.450
The wet low hills of the Black Sea mountains 

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.210
are home to over 200,000 free tea gardens, 

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.890
who give Turkey all the tea it wants for a good drink. 

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.289
The more I go into the mountains, 

00:29:41.289 --> 00:29:46.849
the more I can see how very, very key tea growing is to this area. 

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:48.970
You can almost smell it. 

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.210
Any tiny little space on the sides of the hill, 

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.609
there is a row of tea plants. 

00:29:58.089 --> 00:30:02.049
I have been asked to help pick tea. 

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:03.450
It is an early start, 

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.849
so bed and food in the morning are part of it. 

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.890
Sibel shows me to brother and sister Lale and Gokhan. 

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:18.769
They are Hemshin, a small group of people from Armenia. 

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:21.410
They still live in their family home, 

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.970
which I am told has a bit of a story of its own. 

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.650
How long have you lived here? 

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.650
Do you know how old the house is? 

00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:39.130
OK. 

00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:41.970
So nice and creaky. 

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.529
And that is their mother. 

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.730
So, it was their grandpa that made this house from new. 

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.410
But he never got to live in it 

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.690
because he died very young in Poland. 

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.769
He was shot in the First World War. 

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.690
The hand marks are from when they killed an animal 

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:25.130
to make the house good when the last base parts were put in. 

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.450
Gosh, killing an animal. 

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.690
All I did was open a bottle of wine when I moved in. 

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.809
Gosh. 

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.930
After a good night's sleep, it is time to pick some tea. 

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.020
One more of Turkey's key dry kept foods is rice. 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.300
And pilaf is a loved food of the land. 

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.420
First, wash the rice three times to take off any extra starch. 

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.060
Melt butter in a pan. 

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.180
Add four big spoons of orzo. 

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.180
And 250g of baldo Turkish rice. 

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.300
Add chicken water. 

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.180
Make it boil, and then let it cook soft for ten minutes. 

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.420
My pilaf uses half a kilo of fresh mussels. 

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.060
Cover the pan and steam for five minutes. 

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.180
Chop some dill and then add it to the pan. 

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.620
Fluff the rice with a fork and serve in a bowl. 

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.180
The rice base can have many fillings, 

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.580
but my next trip is to try one that is new to me. 

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.860
So, before I go home, there is one last stop I want to make 

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.020
on the sides of the Black Sea. 

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.980
I have come to Hopa, which is a few miles from the Georgian line, 

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.100
because this is the start of a very special time. 

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.300
It is the short time for hamsi, 

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.580
the tiny little fish that are very, very liked. 

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.740
And tonight we will be cooking them and having fun for the time. 

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.020
The hamsi is a Black Sea small fish 

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.380
and is known in Turkey as the king of fish. 

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.500
For the Laz people who live here, 

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.820
a strong way of life has grown from this short but full time. 

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.500
It is said that they never run out of ways to cook hamsi, 

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.340
even putting it in a sweet food. 

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.980
But, in late years, big fishing boats have come in, 

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.060
making it hard for these local fish men to make a living. 

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.380
A fishing boat leaves the dock to look for its fish for the day. 

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.980
I am helping Tuna in the kitchen to make hamsi pilaf. 

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.980
It has been the main food of their good times for many years. 

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.100
The fish used in this food have been brought from the big boats' catch 

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.700
sold at the local shop. 

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.300
This shows clear how much 

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.980
the local fishing work has changed. 

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.580
Covering the whole base of the baking pan 

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.260
with the little cut anchovies, and... 

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.820
Which is quite hard because they are very slippy. 

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.980
Other people's kitchens, they are a joy to cook in 

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.420
but they are also a bit scary. 

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.300
Most when you are cooking foods 

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.540
that they have done all their life, and you are doing for the first time. 

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.780
The rice is added to the soft onions and covered in oil. 

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.260
And now the other things are added. 

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.900
Tomato paste, chili bits, 

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.380
dried mint and flour from local corn. 

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.140
While we make the salad to go with it, 

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.420
Tuna thinks of kid days before the big boats came. 

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.660
SHE SPEAKS HER OWN WORDS

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.460
When we were kids... 

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.220
we used to be able to come down to the water and get them 

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.860
in our T-shirts, you know. 

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.140
Really? That many? 
Yes, catching them in my hand, there were so many,

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.260
but not any more. 
So, where have they gone?

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.100
It is mostly because these big ships are now using radar things 

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.260
to find where the fish are, so they get all of them in one go. 

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.220
It is not that there are not any fish, 

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.740
but for us little boats, there is not much left, 

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.260
so then we get very little left over, you know. 

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.380
It is luck. 

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.700
The dish is put together and ready for the oven. 

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.060
That smells good. 
It smells so good. 

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.900
Just smell that dried mint and that little bit of chili 

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.300
that is in the rice. 

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.020
Like that? 

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.620
And now, just some very key last touches. 

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.380
Pretty! 

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.220
Great. 

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.460
No, thank you. 

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.340
It is night, and the boat comes back. 

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.060
With nothing. 

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.420
But this small thing is not going to stop the party. 

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.300
We need two people down stairs. 

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.820
There is more than a little mess here. 

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.300
We thought we need one more table, so it could not go down the stairs, 

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.100
so it came through the window. 

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.740
But then, for some reason, all other things - 

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.180
glasses, plates, table cloth, chairs, 

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.580
and most of the food - has come out of the window 

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.860
with us all reaching up and grabbing it best we can. 

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.460
I am not quite sure why we did not just use the stairs. 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.860
The big meal is set out, 

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.180
with its great main dish, the hamsi pilaf. 

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.020
The party has started. 

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.860
Cheers. 
Cheers.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.660
More rice. 

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.540
This is the dish. 
I would love some, thank you.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.340
THE dish. 
THE dish.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.180
Mmm! 

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.860
So, this is how the Laz party. 

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.100
What I really love is the way that as someone else comes to the table, 

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.900
you just all move over and move over. 

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.980
And you started with six, 

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.580
and at some point you are going to be sat on each other's laps. 

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.300
You never say no to a guest. 
Yes.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.820
The hamsi were always key to staying alive in winter months, 

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.780
and the fish men try to make them come faster 

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.780
through a special dance called the horon, 

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.300
said to be like the moving fish in the nets. 

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.300
These old ways, this dance, this way of talking, 

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.780
is just for this tiny group. 

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.580
And I was asking Sibel, who has been with me this whole trip, 

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.060
why she did not know the words, and she said, 

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.900
because this is a way of talking that even she did not speak. 

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.980
It is of a tiny little group. 

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.660
A group that is staying together 

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.460
and singing together and eating together. 

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.260
They fish, that is what they do, their lives are about fish. 

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.620
They are about the sea side. 
This is where they have been for years 

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.220
and this is where they should be. 

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.660
And they are going to keep this 

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.260
for as long as they can. 

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.340
That there seem to be less hamsi 

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.180
makes these good times a bit sad too. 

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.860
But the good feel of the people 

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.900
and how proud they are of their ways makes you feel good too. 

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.260
Turkey is huge. 

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.500
I thought I knew it. 

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.340
I thought I knew the land and its food. 

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.580
I could not have been more wrong. 

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.380
This is like a picture made of small special parts, 

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.900
each with their own past. 

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.820
I started this trip tasting the food of the kings 

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.540
with its richness and how fancy it was. 

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.020
That was a bit of a wrong idea, 

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.460
because the real heart of the food here 

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.420
is found in country parts. 

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.980
It is different groups living quite close 

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.580
but very, very different. 

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.460
It is about keeping their old ways, their way of life. 

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.860
Even their ways of talking. 

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.300
It is also about keeping your food, 

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.620
if it is fish, if it is milk food, 

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.420
if it is fruit and plants. 

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.980
But having fun with them when they are here, 

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.020
and then, smart ways of keeping them for the winter, 

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.340
for the dark days when there is very little else. 

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.500
This is a truly different Turkey from the one I thought I would see 

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.180
when I got off that plane.

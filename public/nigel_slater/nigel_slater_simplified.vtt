00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:07.838
I'm Nigel Slater. I adore cooking at Christmas. 

00:00:07.838 --> 00:00:09.997
For a couple of very special weeks, 

00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:13.439
food becomes something magical -.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.757
For me, food is quite simply the essential.

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.836
in having a great time. 

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:22.797
Family and friends, good food and drink is all you need. 

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:25.317
Christmas doesn't need to be.

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:28.516
And special definitely doesn't have.

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.356
You just need to keep it simple! 

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:32.595
That's a really lovely way to start a meal. 

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.359
So tonight I want to share the run-up to my Christmas. 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.276
Before the big day, there's all my favourites. 

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:43.718
Like a luxurious hot pot and.

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:45.517
Delightful! 

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:47.197
And then Christmas Day itself, 

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.156
complete with sparkling sea bass starter, 

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:53.398
and a delicious roast duck. 

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:55.319
It's the most amazing smell. 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:57.156
And a majestic festive trifle. 

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:03.999
And because no Christmas is complete.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.837
I'll be off to Scotland to find out 

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:09.637
how Christmas is celebrated, Highland-style. 

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:10.996
That is delicious. 

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:15.438
This is one Christmas menu you won't want to be without. 

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:24.716
For me, festive food is the most special food of all. 

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:28.676
Christmas gives us all the perfect excuse to take our time, 

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:31.837
push the boat out, make a fuss of family and friends, 

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:35.115
and eat a bit more too! 

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:39.277
Lots of food. Too much food. 

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:41.637
Every meat you can eat, spread across the table. 

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:45.956
It's like Sunday roast on an epic scale, isn't it. It's fantastic. 

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:50.036
I'm from Yorkshire, so Yorkshire puddings and the works. 

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:53.798
We have goose in our house. 

00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:58.197
We have roast goose that my mum probably puts on about 6am. 

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:01.756
You just smell it throughout the morning. It's lovely. 

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:05.277
We often toy with the idea of a goose or a duck, or some beef, 

00:02:05.277 --> 00:02:07.438
but I can't get it past the wife, to be honest. 

00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:09.836
She's a great fan of turkey. 

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:13.079
But Christmas isn't just one meal. 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.597
It's lots of mini-feasts, leading up to the big day. 

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:22.758
My first festive supper was always a.

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:28.276
This time of year always reminds me of my dad's one attempt at.

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:30.638
Every year, he'd go through the fridges, 

00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:32.518
he'd go through the cupboards, 

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.079
and find all sorts of little goodies, 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.675
and he'd make them into one huge stew. 

00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:41.836
It was his annual contribution.

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:44.395
And you know what? It was delicious. 

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.996
Sometimes it was better than.

00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:49.996
but it was just a lovely thing for him to do. 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.638
Every Christmas I love to carry on Dad's.

00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:59.758
with my own version of his casserole. 

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:02.395
Sometimes I chuck in a bit of turkey or ham, 

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.436
but today I'm sticking to veg. 

00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:08.877
A couple of onions will give me a base, 

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:12.638
cooked quite slowly with some butter.

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:16.955
And then some good wintry herbs. 

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:19.317
Rosemary's one of those herbs 

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:22.395
that sees you good right the way through the winter. 

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:25.236
Its stems and leaves are tough enough 

00:03:25.236 --> 00:03:27.276
to stand the most fearsome frosts. 

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:29.996
And with this, one of my favourite spices of all -.

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:34.996
The wonderful thing about them is that they smell of gin and tonic. 

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:38.675
A bit of salt makes the berries easier to crush. 

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:47.276
So put the juniper and.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:52.638
A couple of bay leaves as well. 

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:55.877
And instantly it smells like a frosty.

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:58.996
There's something about juniper and.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:02.157
that just have that frosty wintriness to them. 

00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.638
The heart and soul of my casserole 

00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:10.836
is going to be some good old winter veg. 

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:18.398
Even in mid winter I don't peel carrots. 

00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:21.596
It's very rare that their outer skin is tough. 

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:27.036
They can just go in in big generous lumps. 

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:32.517
Follow that with any other sweet root veg. 

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:36.716
In my case parsnip and that unsung hero, swede. 

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:41.675
Keep all the vegetables roughly.

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:44.636
so they're ready at the same time. 

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:48.435
So I'm going to put that over a low heat, with a lid on, 

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.555
so the veggies get a chance to soak up all the butter, 

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:52.755
the spice and the herbs. 

00:04:52.755 --> 00:04:55.836
If you've got a drop of Christmas booze hanging around, 

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:58.875
a splash will give this a sweet and mellow festive warmth. 

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:04.797
I'm using marsala, but madeira.

00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:12.675
A spoonful of flour will help give me a lovely.

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:14.755
Some people get so sniffy 

00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:16.755
about putting a bit of flour in a casserole. 

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:18.237
I mean, seriously! 

00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:20.435
As long as you cook it through, 

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:23.196
so you don't have a raw taste of flour, 

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:24.916
it's going to be absolutely.

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:28.636
Now I want something else in there. Something a little bit meaty. 

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:31.076
I'm going to put some chestnuts in. 

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:35.276
Chestnuts make this a really Christmas-y.

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:39.196
Then everything's bought together with.

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:41.716
Turkey stock would be tasty here, 

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.156
but a good veg stock like this will work nicely too. 

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:49.675
Lastly, a twist of pepper. 

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:51.476
Give it up to half an hour 

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.555
to let the vegetables get to know each other. 

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:59.476
# Have yourself a merry little Christmas 

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:04.357
# Let your heart be light 

00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:09.237
# From now on, our troubles will be out of sight... # 

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:19.435
Let's see how this is getting on. 

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:23.476
It's always worth tasting something.

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:28.237
so that any additions you make to it have got time to work their.

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.797
Don't leave your tasting till the end. 

00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:38.276
That's nice enough, but it needs some beefiness to it. 

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:40.036
It needs some depth. 

00:06:40.036 --> 00:06:42.875
I'm going to pop some mushrooms in. 

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:48.156
When my dad used to make this, he'd go through the cupboards, 

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:51.476
and he'd always end up doing that same old seasoning. 

00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:56.875
It would be Worcestershire sauce and.

00:06:58.237 --> 00:07:01.716
But these mushrooms will give me plenty of flavour. 

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:05.958
So all I'm adding is a handful of dried porcini for a.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:11.675
Then a spoonful of mustard to balance the sweet.

00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:16.476
I'm using a grainy mustard. You can use smooth. 

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:17.958
Stir that in. 

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.716
After around half an hour, 

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:29.555
the veg should be soft and lovely and tender. 

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.675
A final addition is a.

00:07:34.916 --> 00:07:38.076
It'll make the sauce beautifully.

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:40.755
This is the bit of cooking I love above all others. 

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:44.596
It's the moment when you decide on the seasoning. 

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:48.716
You taste and you decide whether it needs a bit more salt, 

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:51.636
a bit of lemon juice, a bit of mustard. 

00:07:51.636 --> 00:07:54.076
It's when you put your signature on a stew. 

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:57.276
It's got nothing to do with following.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.916
it's all about your flavours. 

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.797
What you love. 

00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:11.115
It's making sure everybody gets 

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:15.435
plenty of the sweet roots sauce 

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:18.115
and the mushrooms too. 

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:24.636
And just to make it a bit more festive, 

00:08:24.636 --> 00:08:27.916
I'm finishing it all off with a sprinkling of.

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:31.555
This is spoon and fork food, rather than knife and fork. 

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:38.917
Plenty of sauce, a mushroom. 

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.956
There's a good sweetness to that. 

00:08:47.956 --> 00:08:51.398
It's from the root vegetables and the.

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:54.836
Then there's a depth, an almost woodsy quality to it, 

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.758
which is from the mushrooms. 

00:08:56.758 --> 00:09:00.475
It's cheap and it's exactly what I want to come back into the house for 

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:02.037
on a freezing cold day. 

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:06.676
Every Christmas I make this.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:08.956
depending on what's around. 

00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:11.836
It's the sauce that really makes or breaks it though. 

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:16.239
So keep tasting and adjusting the flavours to suit you. 

00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:20.398
I think my dad would be particularly proud of this one! 

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:41.436
There are some things that Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without. 

00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:44.999
Whether it's the little family.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.436
or the food we put on the table, 

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:51.157
the memories are what make this time of year so special. 

00:09:56.518 --> 00:10:00.676
For me, the traditions begin at the start of the.

00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:05.277
where there's one thing I definitely have to have.

00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:08.076
This time of year, 

00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:11.475
there's nearly always a big bowl of nuts in the house. 

00:10:11.475 --> 00:10:16.475
There's walnuts, pecan nuts, almonds and.

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:20.277
I have a real soft spot for Christmas nuts. 

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:25.355
One of the first things I bake is a big tray of chocolate nut flapjacks. 

00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:28.037
A perfect treat for any carol.

00:10:28.037 --> 00:10:30.436
or unexpected guests who pop by. 

00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:32.556
I'm starting by chopping up some walnuts. 

00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:35.917
But any of your Christmas nuts would be great. 

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:38.239
The recipes I really like at this time of year 

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:43.436
are the ones that are a little bit healthy, and a little bit naughty. 

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:45.999
Sort of saint and sinner all in one. 

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:51.676
Not just nuts but dried fruits as well. 

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:54.398
Things like wonderful dried figs. 

00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:59.436
I remember my father used to buy lots of nuts. 

00:10:59.436 --> 00:11:02.556
He'd line them up on the arm of the chair. 

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.596
When they were all shelled, he'd then start to eat them. 

00:11:05.596 --> 00:11:09.596
It was sort of like a Christmas and New Year ritual. 

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:16.596
You really can throw in any dried fruits and nuts here. 

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:21.119
Along with my walnuts and figs, I'm trying some sour cherries, 

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:26.475
cranberries, and a handful of.

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:32.239
Give it a quick blitz. I don't want it to be too fine. 

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:35.316
I want my biscuits to have quite a bit of texture to them. 

00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:43.239
A spoonful of ground almonds will help bring the mixture.

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:48.436
A few whole pumpkins seeds. 

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:51.556
I want this to have a really crunchy texture. 

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.797
That's enough healthy stuff. Time for a treat. 

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.037
Some butter. 

00:11:56.037 --> 00:11:59.878
About 100g of sugar in there as well. 

00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:02.758
I want something really sticky. 

00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:06.556
I'm going to use a bit of golden syrup. You could use maple syrup. 

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.797
Stir, very gently 

00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:18.836
the melted butter, 

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:21.239
the golden syrup 

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.638
and the caster sugar. 

00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:29.956
A mix of fine porridge oats and coarser rolled oats 

00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:32.355
will give my flapjacks a soft, chewy texture. 

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.999
You could use either, or both. 

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:39.917
Turn the heat off and then I mix in all the dried fruits and nuts. 

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:45.076
Make sure the mixture is well padded in the baking tray 

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:47.917
so it doesn't go crumbly. 

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:52.956
That goes in the oven at 160 for about 25 minutes. 

00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:00.037
# Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling 

00:13:00.037 --> 00:13:02.556
# Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too 

00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:06.398
# Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride.

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:11.999
# Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you-hoo 

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:16.716
# Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride.

00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:19.475
# Ting-a-ling-a-ling a ling-long-ling! 

00:13:19.475 --> 00:13:22.436
# Ting-a-ling-a-ling a ling-long-ling! 

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.518
# Ting-a-ling-a-ling a ling-long-ling! 

00:13:24.518 --> 00:13:28.157
# Ting-a-ling-a-ling a ting-long-ling!... # 

00:13:28.157 --> 00:13:31.556
These flapjacks would be great as they are, 

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:35.076
but my Christmas version always.

00:13:35.076 --> 00:13:38.398
Heat a bar or two of your favourite 

00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:40.716
over some simmering water until.

00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:44.518
Dunk! 

00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:53.638
This is partly flapjack, partly.

00:13:53.638 --> 00:13:56.556
and partly chocolate biscuit. 

00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:58.956
It's rather having a healthy main course, 

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:02.076
followed by a slightly naughty.

00:14:04.355 --> 00:14:07.037
You could send me off to school with these in my tuck box 

00:14:07.037 --> 00:14:08.836
and I'd love you for ever. 

00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:18.999
I know Christmas has officially.

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:20.797
when these make an appearance. 

00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:24.556
Just make sure you get first dibs because they'll go really quick. 

00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:37.596
That's crisp and chewy. 

00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:44.836
And it feels partly very good for me and partly a little bit.

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.878
It suits me fine. 

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:56.556
I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate 

00:14:56.556 --> 00:15:00.355
the start of the holidays than with these gorgeous flapjacks. 

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:02.475
A perfect treat for Christmas.

00:15:02.475 --> 00:15:04.556
I might even save one for Santa. 

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:27.999
I always associate Christmas with.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:29.956
And, frankly, the frostier the weather, 

00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:31.716
the more magical the experience.

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:37.758
So, I've come to the chilly north east coast of Scotland 

00:15:37.758 --> 00:15:41.037
and to a farm where the McKenzies do Christmas.

00:15:41.037 --> 00:15:44.878
Robert and his friend, Andy,.

00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:48.797
and have invited me to come and see how they do it, Highland style. 

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:53.277
Christmas and New Year in the Highlands is a big event. 

00:15:53.277 --> 00:15:56.157
There's lot of parties in all the various farm houses 

00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:58.277
and castles and whatever round.

00:15:58.277 --> 00:16:02.239
And, er, it's a great time for everyone to get together 

00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:04.398
and lots of eating, drinking, dancing 

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:08.556
- all the cliches you think of the Highlands. 

00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:12.239
They actually come together Christmas and New Year time. It's good fun. 

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:16.475
Of course there's only one place to throw a real Highland gathering - 

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:17.596
a castle. 

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:20.758
Luckily, Robert's friends happen to.

00:16:20.758 --> 00:16:24.436
It's very nice to cook in a castle kitchen. How come? 

00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:26.999
There is a bit of a story behind this castle here. 

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:32.196
About 100 years ago, my great.

00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:38.475
This castle here was a ruin. And the current owner who restored it 

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:40.596
was a good friend of my dad's at school. 

00:16:40.596 --> 00:16:42.999
It was a total ruin! 

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:47.556
It was a total ruin. A few bits of stone here and a few there. 

00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:50.676
Right open to the skies, it was inhabited by sheep. 

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.518
It's a very special place, 

00:16:52.518 --> 00:16:54.797
because it's coming back to my old family roots 

00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:58.797
and it's been totally transformed. 

00:16:58.797 --> 00:17:00.797
Quite often at Christmas and New Year, 

00:17:00.797 --> 00:17:04.117
we're always down here for parties. And lots of food, dancing. 

00:17:04.117 --> 00:17:06.519
Do you like a party up here? 

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:10.278
We can't just pop out to the cinema or, er... 

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:13.637
Most of us have probably been banned from the pub at some point. 

00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:16.637
So, you've got to go to wherever they'll take you. 

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:21.837
Every year, the boys cook venison for their guests, 

00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:24.998
but, this Christmas, they're adding a new twist. 

00:17:24.998 --> 00:17:27.198
It's the first year Robert has produced oil 

00:17:27.198 --> 00:17:29.998
from the family's rapeseed harvest, 

00:17:29.998 --> 00:17:32.278
so they're using that to cook something special. 

00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:34.317
They want to try it out on me first. 

00:17:35.317 --> 00:17:39.157
Robert's starting by blistering some.

00:17:39.157 --> 00:17:41.478
That oil is very special. 

00:17:42.998 --> 00:17:48.637
Now, I wouldn't ever cook with my best olive oil. 

00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:50.798
Why would I cook with my best rapeseed oil? 

00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:52.678
This is a special occasion. 

00:17:55.637 --> 00:17:59.678
We're hoping tonight to cook for some of our friends and family 

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:02.837
and, with the rapeseed oil, it has a higher flashpoint. 

00:18:02.837 --> 00:18:04.917
You can cook to higher.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:09.357
So, you can get it hot, before it starts to smoke and burn. 

00:18:09.357 --> 00:18:12.678
Exactly that! The very light flavour of the.

00:18:12.678 --> 00:18:18.157
and the butteriness, the grassiness,.

00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:20.597
Andy's carving his meat straight from the bone, 

00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:23.958
but you can get your butcher to do this all for you. 

00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:27.278
And, dare I ask, if I didn't want to use venison for this, 

00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:29.397
what else could I do it with? 

00:18:29.397 --> 00:18:33.238
Beef. It's a very similar meat - red meat. Anything. 

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.238
That is a good hunk of meat. 

00:18:37.238 --> 00:18:39.478
Very lean. 

00:18:39.478 --> 00:18:41.397
Less fat than skinless chicken. 

00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:44.357
What's the point of skinless chicken? 

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:47.157
We're just sort of blistering up the skins of chillies. 

00:18:49.397 --> 00:18:54.637
And, er, the oil will be taking on some of the heat from the skin. 

00:18:54.637 --> 00:18:58.837
A couple of softened red onions will add sweetness. 

00:19:00.117 --> 00:19:02.597
So, do you cook a lot? 

00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:03.637
Yeah. 

00:19:03.637 --> 00:19:06.637
It seems to be Rob and I though, the ones who cook. 

00:19:06.637 --> 00:19:08.877
Although all of our friends are pretty handy. 

00:19:08.877 --> 00:19:11.958
And everyone up here can cook 

00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958
because everyone's got so much.

00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.917
But it does seem to be Rob and I that usually take on the task 

00:19:16.917 --> 00:19:18.798
and feed the thousands. 

00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:23.317
I think we're ready for some venison in the pan. 

00:19:23.317 --> 00:19:25.958
So, it depends how you like your steaks. 

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.519
I like mine rare, so about two minutes on each side. 

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:31.917
But the key thing about this is always undercook your steaks. 

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.877
You can always put them back in but you can't take them out. 

00:19:34.877 --> 00:19:38.397
Do you let venison rest, the way you would beef? 

00:19:38.397 --> 00:19:42.438
Ideally I'd let it rest for the same amount of time you'd cook it for. 

00:19:42.438 --> 00:19:44.877
So, if you cook it for about two minutes either side, 

00:19:44.877 --> 00:19:46.637
rest it for two minutes. 

00:19:46.637 --> 00:19:50.117
Well, it's a nice rule of thumb. I can remember that. 

00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:55.077
To me, straight away, that is a beautiful pan of food. 

00:19:55.077 --> 00:19:56.678
Yeah. 

00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:59.718
It looks fabulous even before you put it on the plate. 

00:19:59.718 --> 00:20:03.117
You've got the golden oil. You've got a crust on the meat. 

00:20:03.117 --> 00:20:05.597
And the chillies and the onions. That's fabulous. 

00:20:05.597 --> 00:20:09.837
Andy's throwing in a few dried figs for a bit of bite. 

00:20:13.038 --> 00:20:16.998
The seeds in the figs kind of pop when you start eating them. 

00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:18.877
- That crunchy popping. - Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:18.877 --> 00:20:21.998
It goes really well with the texture of the meat. 

00:20:21.998 --> 00:20:26.157
How could you resist that? Just putting it on the table as it is? 

00:20:26.157 --> 00:20:27.557
It looks beautiful. 

00:20:29.678 --> 00:20:32.278
The boys' final addition is a good glug 

00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:35.917
of a very traditional venison.

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:38.478
And a slosh of balsamic.

00:20:38.478 --> 00:20:39.637
That's local. 

00:20:39.637 --> 00:20:41.798
It is, yeah. 

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:44.917
Then there's the all-important couple of minutes' rest, 

00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:47.077
before Andy can dish up. 

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.438
Just look at all that... 

00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:56.759
All those gooey, sticky bits of lovely.

00:20:56.759 --> 00:21:01.077
- I'm going to try and scrape off...  - Please do. 

00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:03.438
That looks splendid. 

00:21:12.478 --> 00:21:16.317
I love the sweetness of the figs and the onions. 

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.798
And the chilli. There is a bit of heat there. 

00:21:18.798 --> 00:21:22.117
There really is. 

00:21:22.117 --> 00:21:28.038
- I'm loving this. This is sumptuous. Thank you so much. - Our pleasure. 

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:32.438
If the boys cook like this for their party, 

00:21:32.438 --> 00:21:35.357
I think their guests are in for a real treat. 

00:21:46.397 --> 00:21:49.718
Taking a break from the kitchen over Christmas is a must. 

00:21:49.718 --> 00:21:55.038
An afternoon in the fresh air always works up a great.

00:21:58.077 --> 00:22:00.998
You never know, you might pick up a couple of tips 

00:22:00.998 --> 00:22:02.759
to take back to the kitchen as well. 

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:05.357
Lovely smell of the roasted.

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:06.958
All you've got to do it make sure 

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.718
that you just cut each of the chestnuts. 

00:22:09.718 --> 00:22:11.117
They tend to pop otherwise. 

00:22:11.117 --> 00:22:13.557
A nice, warm place to be as well, on a cold day, 

00:22:13.557 --> 00:22:15.357
stood in front of the chestnuts. 

00:22:20.837 --> 00:22:22.357
Chestnuts and mince pies 

00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:25.157
might be traditional Christmas fare.

00:22:25.157 --> 00:22:27.917
but, for me, the holidays as a lad bring back memories 

00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:30.519
of something a bit different. 

00:22:34.357 --> 00:22:37.397
When I was a boy, you could always tell what time of year it was 

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:39.798
by the sort of cheese we had in the house. 

00:22:39.798 --> 00:22:43.317
At this time of year, there was always a bit of blue. 

00:22:44.718 --> 00:22:47.998
Even now, I have to have Stilton at Christmas. 

00:22:47.998 --> 00:22:51.077
Every year, it makes its first.

00:22:51.077 --> 00:22:52.117
before the big day - 

00:22:52.117 --> 00:22:56.519
when I use it to make this luxurious winter slaw. 

00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:02.117
Red cabbage and blue cheese are a perfect pairing, 

00:23:02.117 --> 00:23:04.357
so that's going to be my base. 

00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:10.438
Fennel is one of those crisp, wintry tastes. 

00:23:10.438 --> 00:23:13.557
It reminds me of when I was a kid and used to go to the sweet shop. 

00:23:13.557 --> 00:23:16.238
It's that same aniseed flavour. 

00:23:16.238 --> 00:23:20.597
Whenever I think of celery,.

00:23:20.597 --> 00:23:22.759
It's the old ploughman's lunch thing. 

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:26.478
You can't beat a British apple with celery and cheese, 

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:28.917
the sharper the better in my kitchen. 

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:32.117
A good squeeze of lemon will stop them going brown. 

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:36.117
I want a slightly different.

00:23:36.117 --> 00:23:40.877
one that's as seasonal as Santa -.

00:23:42.998 --> 00:23:45.759
This is the best time of year for walnuts. 

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.998
When they're still very pale inside. 

00:23:47.998 --> 00:23:51.877
The paler the walnut, the sweeter it is. 

00:23:51.877 --> 00:23:58.077
You can buy them ready shelled but it's not half as much fun. 

00:23:58.077 --> 00:24:01.637
You need about eight to ten good sized nuts here. 

00:24:01.637 --> 00:24:04.238
You could you pecans or cashews, 

00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:06.759
anything that will add a bit of crunch. 

00:24:08.357 --> 00:24:11.478
All nuts taste really good straight from the shell. 

00:24:11.478 --> 00:24:16.557
But that flavour intensifies almost.

00:24:16.557 --> 00:24:19.317
Even for a salad, I'd want to do that. 

00:24:25.917 --> 00:24:27.759
This will need a dressing. 

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.837
I'm after something clean and bright, 

00:24:29.837 --> 00:24:33.278
so I'm making a base with red wine vinegar - 

00:24:33.278 --> 00:24:35.317
the salt just softens its sharpness. 

00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:40.397
A teaspoon or so of smooth, mild mustard 

00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:43.998
and then some oil... groundnut feels like it fits. 

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:49.157
Then, because of what's happening in the salad, 

00:24:49.157 --> 00:24:52.917
with the nuts and the apples, I've got some walnut oil. 

00:24:52.917 --> 00:24:57.157
You don't need much walnut oil. It's got really good flavour. 

00:25:09.077 --> 00:25:12.198
Then it's just a case of adding the final bits - 

00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:14.759
the apples, toasted walnuts 

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:18.597
and, of course, my very festive bit of blue. 

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:25.877
What I don't want to do is to make a creamy cheese dressing. 

00:25:25.877 --> 00:25:28.357
I want to have discernible pieces 

00:25:28.357 --> 00:25:31.397
with this beautiful Stilton in my.

00:25:33.678 --> 00:25:36.397
I'm just going to crumble the pieces. 

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:02.798
Tufts from the fennel, I'm not going to waste those. 

00:26:08.478 --> 00:26:12.397
Crisp textures, quite strong flavours. 

00:26:12.397 --> 00:26:16.958
Great colours for a cold day. 

00:26:25.238 --> 00:26:26.759
Delightful! 

00:26:33.597 --> 00:26:37.557
This is my favourite alternative.

00:26:37.557 --> 00:26:42.038
It's brighter and fresher and the strong flavours and crisp.

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:46.157
never fail to get the taste buds going, ready for the feast to come. 

00:27:06.357 --> 00:27:08.637
At Christmas, it's not just about the food. 

00:27:08.637 --> 00:27:11.117
It's about who you share it with. 

00:27:11.117 --> 00:27:15.597
It doesn't need to be a fancy meal - just a sociable, happy one. 

00:27:15.597 --> 00:27:17.877
That's what people remember, 

00:27:17.877 --> 00:27:21.077
not whether you burnt the sprouts or not! 

00:27:21.077 --> 00:27:24.998
My family tend to visit all the.

00:27:24.998 --> 00:27:27.238
We jump in the car, drive to one house, get fed. 

00:27:27.238 --> 00:27:28.397
Go to another, get fed. 

00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:31.038
It's about eating as many dinners as we could.

00:27:31.038 --> 00:27:32.837
over the course of the day. 

00:27:36.597 --> 00:27:40.157
We live in a lovely little village and I've got three kids now. 

00:27:40.157 --> 00:27:42.438
So we carry a lot of those traditions on. 

00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:47.077
There's a really nice carol service in the Market Square,.

00:27:47.077 --> 00:27:51.917
where they serve a lot of mulled wine and mince pies. 

00:27:51.917 --> 00:27:54.238
Can you see the Christmas tree? 

00:27:56.357 --> 00:27:59.958
For me, Christmas Day is all about making that extra bit of.

00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:03.278
Which is why this year I'm going all out - 

00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:05.837
with a stunning little sea bass starter, 

00:28:05.837 --> 00:28:09.917
an even tastier alternative to.

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:12.678
a brand new festive fizz. 

00:28:12.678 --> 00:28:15.278
And the real icing on the cake - 

00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:17.077
my gorgeous trifle 

00:28:17.077 --> 00:28:20.718
that no Christmas is complete without. 

00:28:34.637 --> 00:28:38.397
But first, there's the Christmas Eve tea. 

00:28:38.397 --> 00:28:41.478
It's usually a humble treat to make sure there's plenty of room 

00:28:41.478 --> 00:28:43.397
for the next day's feast. 

00:28:43.397 --> 00:28:46.357
This is my favourite - it's quick, easy, 

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:48.478
and has a bit of luxury to it too. 

00:28:51.478 --> 00:28:55.438
There's a lovely way with.

00:28:55.438 --> 00:28:59.597
that just involves peeling off the skin, 

00:28:59.597 --> 00:29:02.837
crumbling the fish into a dish, 

00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:05.519
you can do it with smoked trout as well. 

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:07.478
Probably do it with sardines. 

00:29:07.478 --> 00:29:09.678
And mash in a bit of cream. 

00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:15.597
Grate a little bit of cheese into it. I'm using Parmesan. 

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:20.357
A twist of black pepper. 

00:29:22.397 --> 00:29:24.759
Just a few chives. 

00:29:26.117 --> 00:29:30.958
Fold the fish and the cream, 

00:29:30.958 --> 00:29:34.238
cheese and chives together. 

00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:51.958
I could put a little bit of ground chilli in there. 

00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:53.718
Something with a little bit of heat. 

00:29:53.718 --> 00:29:56.597
But I've got something much better. 

00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:06.117
The traditional accompaniment for smoked.

00:30:06.117 --> 00:30:07.798
Fresh horseradish. 

00:30:07.798 --> 00:30:10.519
Not much. It's got quite a pep to it. 

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:12.438
You can pick up horseradish 

00:30:12.438 --> 00:30:15.637
at any farmers' market or good.

00:30:15.637 --> 00:30:18.198
Most people associate it with roast beef, 

00:30:18.198 --> 00:30:20.637
but I love it even more with smoked fish. 

00:30:25.038 --> 00:30:27.877
A little bit more cream. A tiny bit more cheese. 

00:30:31.597 --> 00:30:33.597
And then back under the grill. 

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:51.958
A very smart cheese on toast. 

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:13.238
After all the usual last-minute.

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.837
this is my perfect Christmas Eve supper. 

00:31:15.837 --> 00:31:18.038
Makes a great hangover brunch too! 

00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:41.998
I'm spending the day with Robert and Andy in the Scottish.

00:31:41.998 --> 00:31:44.917
where I've been invited to a Christmas.

00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:46.837
here at their friend's castle. 

00:31:46.837 --> 00:31:49.837
But first, I've offered to give the boys a break 

00:31:49.837 --> 00:31:53.157
from the preparations, and make a.

00:31:53.157 --> 00:31:56.597
I'm not sure it's going to be as delicious as what you cooked for me, 

00:31:56.597 --> 00:31:57.917
but I'm going to have a go. 

00:31:57.917 --> 00:32:01.357
What I want to do is make like a big soup, a family soup. 

00:32:01.357 --> 00:32:06.759
I'm keeping this simple - smoked haddock, milk and a few.

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:09.597
I'm going to pop that on the heat for a bit. 

00:32:09.597 --> 00:32:12.198
- If you see it boil over, tell me. - OK! 

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:19.438
These handsome local leeks will form a great base for my soup. 

00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:22.478
- I love leeks.  - You know, I love leeks! 

00:32:22.478 --> 00:32:25.637
- When I was a kid, I used to have them in cheese sauce. - Yeah. 

00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:29.438
Just a great supper. 

00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:32.198
'The leeks just need softening in a little oil 

00:32:32.198 --> 00:32:37.317
'with some spring onion and a couple of rashers of bacon.' 

00:32:37.317 --> 00:32:43.718
- I'm putting a bit of swede in. Only because... - Turnip. 

00:32:43.718 --> 00:32:47.397
You call that a turnip? Yeah, you see, I call it a swede. 

00:32:47.397 --> 00:32:50.238
Whatever it is, it's going in the soup. 

00:32:59.438 --> 00:33:02.357
'A few little pieces of cauliflower will add a bit of crunch.' 

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:07.397
I used to have a habit of making a big Friday soup 

00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:10.958
where I'd stick everything that was left in the way of veg in the soup 

00:33:10.958 --> 00:33:12.519
and we'd have it all weekend. 

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.837
I think that's what soups are for. 

00:33:14.837 --> 00:33:18.357
That's what I was taught. My mum would always say, 

00:33:18.357 --> 00:33:22.718
"If the veg at the back of the fridge is sliding its way out, 

00:33:22.718 --> 00:33:24.198
"toss it into some soup." 

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:28.718
Using the milk the haddock has been poached in 

00:33:28.718 --> 00:33:32.637
is an easy way to give the soup a lovely smoky.

00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:36.198
These are beautiful. 

00:33:36.198 --> 00:33:40.238
The final ingredient is some.

00:33:40.238 --> 00:33:42.597
They just need heating in a pan with some oil 

00:33:42.597 --> 00:33:45.718
for a couple of minutes, to open them. 

00:33:47.117 --> 00:33:50.877
I'm just going to pop the fish into the soup. 

00:33:52.357 --> 00:33:57.357
Can we use any fish? Does it have to be haddock or can we use...? 

00:33:57.357 --> 00:34:00.759
- No, you can use... - Anything.  - The lovely thing about using this 

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:02.877
is that you get all the smoky flavours. 

00:34:02.877 --> 00:34:04.917
But, yes, you can use anything. 

00:34:10.356 --> 00:34:13.396
I can't believe how juicy these mussels are. Look at that. 

00:34:15.518 --> 00:34:17.998
Great. Love it. 

00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:21.278
A good simmer is a sign we're ready to go. 

00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:33.396
- It really is a main dish, isn't it?  - It IS a main dish. 

00:34:33.396 --> 00:34:34.478
But, as I say, 

00:34:34.478 --> 00:34:39.438
it's one of those dishes that could be for a special occasion, 

00:34:39.438 --> 00:34:43.356
but, also, if you want to put more potatoes in it and things, 

00:34:43.356 --> 00:34:45.958
it can actually be a very cheap.

00:34:50.356 --> 00:34:53.639
- Thank you very much. - Thank you. This looks delicious. 

00:34:57.077 --> 00:34:59.239
Nice mussels. 

00:35:02.356 --> 00:35:06.679
- The sea and the countryside coming together. - It is, isn't it? 

00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:11.918
So good. What about sticking a bit of sherry in it? 

00:35:11.918 --> 00:35:14.876
Mm. A bit of white wine. A bit of dry sherry. 

00:35:14.876 --> 00:35:18.278
A little bit of cider maybe. 

00:35:19.518 --> 00:35:21.597
This is a great soup. I love it. 

00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:25.719
I'll cook for you again. You say nice things. 

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:27.639
You can definitely cook for.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:30.557
What are you doing next weekend? 

00:35:30.557 --> 00:35:33.518
You can really play around with this soup - 

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:36.356
skip the mussels and try different winter veg if you like. 

00:35:37.759 --> 00:35:40.998
For ideas on how to put your spin on all my Christmas recipes, 

00:35:40.998 --> 00:35:43.278
have a look at the website... 

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:04.159
For most of us, 

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:08.117
it's the night before Christmas that's.

00:36:08.117 --> 00:36:12.117
Probably because it involves the.

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:18.396
We did have a tradition where we used to put mince pies 

00:36:18.396 --> 00:36:20.438
and a glass of wine out for Santa - 

00:36:20.438 --> 00:36:22.918
always used to get eaten and drunk. 

00:36:22.918 --> 00:36:26.557
Dad was often late out of bed on Christmas morning, 

00:36:26.557 --> 00:36:28.679
but that was a definite.

00:36:33.798 --> 00:36:38.759
Once Santa has had his fill, it's our turn. 

00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:41.518
The Christmas Day feast has finally.

00:36:41.518 --> 00:36:43.117
there's only way to kick it off. 

00:36:43.117 --> 00:36:46.396
When I was little, I always knew it was Christmas 

00:36:46.396 --> 00:36:49.438
because we had tropical fruits in the house. 

00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:53.597
It was the only time we ever saw a pineapple. 

00:36:54.719 --> 00:36:57.117
And there were other fruits too. 

00:36:57.117 --> 00:37:02.438
Things like passion fruit. And it's the seeds that I absolutely love. 

00:37:02.438 --> 00:37:04.998
That crispness that you get. 

00:37:06.317 --> 00:37:08.918
Along with that little snap of.

00:37:08.918 --> 00:37:12.836
It replaces lemon juice in things like a dressing for fish. 

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:16.239
In fact, this is one of my favourite ways to do fish. 

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:18.798
It makes a sensational little.

00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:20.958
and there's no cooking involved.

00:37:20.958 --> 00:37:22.836
I think you'll like this one. 

00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.396
This dressing is the star here. 

00:37:27.396 --> 00:37:29.199
It needs to be quite sharp, 

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:32.356
so along with the juice and seeds of a few passion fruit, 

00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:34.719
I'm adding a couple of fresh citrus fruits. 

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:40.998
And if you make that dressing acidic enough...with some lime juice... 

00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:44.117
..maybe a little bit of orange, 

00:37:44.117 --> 00:37:49.199
you can actually use it to cook the raw fish. You don't heat it... 

00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:52.998
you just put the fish in this very sharp, acidic dressing 

00:37:52.998 --> 00:37:55.719
and you leave it for a good hour, 

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:58.077
maybe even overnight, 

00:37:58.077 --> 00:38:01.639
and you end up with the freshest-tasting fish. 

00:38:01.639 --> 00:38:04.356
It makes a lovely first course. 

00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:07.759
This dressing will need sweetness. 

00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:11.199
Normally I'd use sugar, but for a treat I'm adding.

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:15.278
What I do...is slit it... 

00:38:17.836 --> 00:38:20.597
..right the way down the length... 

00:38:20.597 --> 00:38:27.159
open it up and, inside, these sticky little black seeds. 

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:37.679
I'm treating myself to some seabass, but you can use other fish.

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:41.117
I could use prawns, I could use trout, a bit of tuna. 

00:38:47.278 --> 00:38:50.478
I love the cooking at this time of year. 

00:38:50.478 --> 00:38:55.239
I love the richness of it, the sweetness, I love all the booze, 

00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:59.356
but there comes a point when I want something that's clean and fresh 

00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:01.918
and simple, and that's exactly this dish. 

00:39:01.918 --> 00:39:06.396
Make sure your fish is thinly sliced and evenly spread in a single.

00:39:06.396 --> 00:39:09.356
before spooning over the dressing, just to make sure 

00:39:09.356 --> 00:39:12.639
that the juice has a chance to cook each bit right through. 

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:18.038
For a little kick and a festive flash of colour, 

00:39:18.038 --> 00:39:20.998
a sprinkling of de-seeded chillies is going in too. 

00:39:20.998 --> 00:39:23.798
Then simply cover and keep cool. 

00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:27.876
It'll need at least an hour, but overnight would be even better. 

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:33.396
There's no oven needed here. The fridge is where the magic happens 

00:39:33.396 --> 00:39:35.597
as the acidic juices cold cook the fish. 

00:39:37.798 --> 00:39:40.597
Now, I'd put that on the table probably just as it is. 

00:39:40.597 --> 00:39:45.958
But I think it deserves a little bit of green herb. 

00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:48.918
I'm going to use a bit of chive. 

00:39:54.356 --> 00:39:57.719
I put them on now rather than at the beginning 

00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:00.396
because it can make the dressing a bit too onion-y. 

00:40:01.998 --> 00:40:06.918
As it's for me, I'm going to put a little bit of coriander on. 

00:40:06.918 --> 00:40:10.759
I know not everybody loves.

00:40:10.759 --> 00:40:13.719
It's a very long way from my dad's Christmas fruit bowl, 

00:40:13.719 --> 00:40:18.639
but it's got the same spirit of adventure and the same.

00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:39.199
The fish is quite soft. It's got the crunch of those little seeds. 

00:40:40.356 --> 00:40:43.356
And you've got this lovely balance of.

00:40:43.356 --> 00:40:46.317
slightly sharp juice 

00:40:46.317 --> 00:40:48.719
and a little nip of chives. 

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:53.199
That's a really lovely way to start a meal. 

00:40:56.278 --> 00:40:58.679
This way of cooking might feel a bit unusual, 

00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:00.798
but you really have to give it a go. 

00:41:00.798 --> 00:41:04.478
Even better, it's the perfect starter to make.

00:41:04.478 --> 00:41:06.918
The result is a surprising and.

00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:09.199
that will impress any Christmas Day guest. 

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:27.998
In the Highlands, the sun is setting on my day with Rob and Andy. 

00:41:27.998 --> 00:41:32.077
There's one last thing they've asked me to do ahead of their party - 

00:41:32.077 --> 00:41:35.117
create a new festive tipple for the toast. 

00:41:35.117 --> 00:41:37.679
I'm no expert cocktail maker, but here goes. 

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:40.719
So what do you drink at Christmas and New Year? 

00:41:40.719 --> 00:41:45.518
Always a bit of champagne and a couple of drams in the evening. 

00:41:45.518 --> 00:41:49.597
I haven't done this before, but I'm just thinking of a drink 

00:41:49.597 --> 00:41:52.557
that's going to be a little bit refreshing 

00:41:52.557 --> 00:41:55.958
cos, at Christmas, I always think the food is so rich... 

00:41:58.597 --> 00:42:02.836
Actually, for me, it's really good to have.

00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:05.876
and a little bit fizzy. 

00:42:07.597 --> 00:42:12.639
I was wondering about putting a little bit of apple.

00:42:14.396 --> 00:42:15.958
A little bit of apple juice... 

00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:18.639
Oh, it smells amazing! 

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:20.759
Yeah. 

00:42:20.759 --> 00:42:23.038
You know what I'm thinking? 

00:42:23.038 --> 00:42:27.639
Because I want this really chilled and I'm thinking of the fruit, 

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:31.356
you've got some fruit in your freezer, haven't you? 

00:42:31.356 --> 00:42:34.038
Yeah, we've got blackcurrants, damsons, 

00:42:34.038 --> 00:42:37.639
- raspberries. - Raspberries. Would.

00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:41.918
- Yeah, I'll get some. - We won't drink it all while you're gone! 

00:42:43.836 --> 00:42:46.077
So as well as the apple brandy, 

00:42:46.077 --> 00:42:49.396
I'm adding a dash of fresh apple juice and a shaving of apple peel. 

00:42:50.798 --> 00:42:56.518
You know like you put a lemon twist...in some drinks? Well, 

00:42:56.518 --> 00:42:59.679
- as it's apple based... - Looks good. 

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:02.958
Ha-hah! Are these your mum's raspberries? 

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:07.679
No, they're actually a friend of mine from Perthshire - Doug's. 

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:12.798
Better than an ice cube, isn't it? 

00:43:12.798 --> 00:43:15.478
- Yeah. - Looks great.  - Four or five in each. 

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:19.836
And then some fizz. I'm not using really posh fizz, 

00:43:19.836 --> 00:43:22.317
I don't think there's any point, really. 

00:43:22.317 --> 00:43:26.199
You can tell a lot about a man by the way he opens a champagne cork. 

00:43:26.199 --> 00:43:28.958
Really?! Do tell. 

00:43:28.958 --> 00:43:32.876
Well, does he go off with a bang or is it a quiet fizz? 

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.159
POP! 

00:43:34.159 --> 00:43:36.117
Hey! Oh! 

00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:49.278
- Well, it looks festive. - Yeah. Thank you very much. - Nice glasses. 

00:43:49.278 --> 00:43:52.998
- Well, cheers. - Cheers. Merry Christmas. - Yeah. - Merry Christmas. 

00:43:57.278 --> 00:44:01.077
- Really nice. - It's lovely. 

00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:04.639
Quite amazing to be drinking a.

00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:09.396
but you get that warming sensation as well from the.

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:12.356
And then at the bottom, we get raspberries. 

00:44:12.356 --> 00:44:14.356
Which have soaked up all the alcohol. 

00:44:14.356 --> 00:44:17.199
Which have soaked up the alcohol! You've done this before! 

00:44:17.199 --> 00:44:22.836
It's kind of like a sexy cider... Do you know what I mean? 

00:44:22.836 --> 00:44:24.836
Sexy cider will do for me! 

00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:28.557
That is delicious! Seriously delicious. 

00:44:28.557 --> 00:44:31.396
It is, isn't it? I'm still drinking it. 

00:44:33.478 --> 00:44:35.438
I'm quite pleased with this one! 

00:44:35.438 --> 00:44:38.759
I just hope it goes down as well with Robert and Andy's guests later. 

00:44:47.719 --> 00:44:51.998
The Christmas main course has to be the most special of all. 

00:44:51.998 --> 00:44:53.239
Ever since I was little, 

00:44:53.239 --> 00:44:57.199
I've had a hunch that the simpler the dish, the tastier the results. 

00:45:05.117 --> 00:45:07.317
To this day whenever I see a duck, 

00:45:07.317 --> 00:45:09.918
I think it must be a special occasion. 

00:45:09.918 --> 00:45:12.199
When I was a kid we used to have them, 

00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:14.317
albeit boil in the bag with orange sauce. 

00:45:14.317 --> 00:45:15.478
And it was delicious. 

00:45:15.478 --> 00:45:18.159
But now whenever anybody special.

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:23.518
or it's a special occasion, then I'll roast a duck. 

00:45:25.798 --> 00:45:28.958
And what could be more special than the Christmas day lunch? 

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:32.679
Turkey is great, but to me, duck feels even more festive 

00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:34.679
and I reckon easier to cook too! 

00:45:38.998 --> 00:45:41.317
I roast my duck on top of a really savoury base, 

00:45:41.317 --> 00:45:43.478
which I start off on the hob 

00:45:43.478 --> 00:45:45.998
with a few bits of bacon, fried over a low heat. 

00:45:45.998 --> 00:45:49.317
Then some potatoes, which will cook in the wonderful fat 

00:45:49.317 --> 00:45:51.317
from the duck as it roasts. 

00:45:53.759 --> 00:45:57.077
I love the skin. I love the meat. 

00:45:58.918 --> 00:46:02.557
But I sometimes think the best of all is the duck fat. 

00:46:02.557 --> 00:46:06.038
It's a very savoury fat. It's got masses of flavour. 

00:46:06.038 --> 00:46:08.798
And it's good with the duck, 

00:46:08.798 --> 00:46:12.478
but it's even better if you can use it for cooking things in. 

00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:17.159
Best of all is when that duck fat 

00:46:17.159 --> 00:46:20.958
is cooked with potatoes. 

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:25.478
Roughly slicing the potatoes will help them to cook.

00:46:25.478 --> 00:46:27.518
I'm just going to add an onion. 

00:46:30.077 --> 00:46:34.038
What I'm doing is making a savoury base 

00:46:34.038 --> 00:46:39.876
that will soak up the duck fat as it roasts. 

00:46:42.597 --> 00:46:44.759
A little bit of seasoning. 

00:46:49.117 --> 00:46:53.396
You could use sage here. Use a bit of rosemary. 

00:46:53.396 --> 00:46:55.597
I'm going to use thyme. 

00:46:58.478 --> 00:47:02.038
Thyme takes longer to cook down and release its flavours, 

00:47:02.038 --> 00:47:06.159
making it a perfect herb for any Christmas roast. 

00:47:08.918 --> 00:47:12.639
Smells great already and I haven't even got the duck in. 

00:47:12.639 --> 00:47:16.557
When the potatoes, onions and.

00:47:16.557 --> 00:47:18.356
simply pop the duck on top. 

00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:24.077
He needs a little bit of seasoning in the form of salt and pepper. 

00:47:24.077 --> 00:47:27.836
I'm just going to prick him all over with a fork. 

00:47:27.836 --> 00:47:32.278
Just to make sure some of his fat runs out into the spuds. 

00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:35.478
I think he just needs a bay leaf. 

00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:46.199
Tuck him in there. 

00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:54.077
And then into a hot oven at 200 degrees. 

00:48:15.396 --> 00:48:18.317
My Christmas duck has to have perfectly crisp skin, 

00:48:18.317 --> 00:48:24.117
so after a good couple of hours, I separate it from the.

00:48:24.117 --> 00:48:26.759
and then give it an extra few minutes 

00:48:26.759 --> 00:48:28.876
at an even higher temperature. 

00:48:30.597 --> 00:48:33.798
You can keep these potatoes warm.

00:48:33.798 --> 00:48:37.317
After about ten minutes, the duck needs to rest a while 

00:48:37.317 --> 00:48:41.317
leaving me plenty of time to make a quick sauce. 

00:48:42.918 --> 00:48:45.077
There's masses of flavour in that pan 

00:48:45.077 --> 00:48:48.876
so I'm going to pour in a little bit of appropriate booze. 

00:48:50.998 --> 00:48:54.679
Could be dry sherry. Could be Madeira,.

00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:02.077
I think this is what heaven must smell like. 

00:49:02.077 --> 00:49:05.518
When you pour fortified wine into a roasting pan 

00:49:05.518 --> 00:49:07.998
full of all the roasting goodies. 

00:49:07.998 --> 00:49:10.518
It is the most amazing smell. 

00:49:10.518 --> 00:49:15.038
It's a smell that just says good times. 

00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:19.278
It's about special occasions. It's about friends and.

00:49:19.278 --> 00:49:22.317
It's about all the good things, all the reasons that I cook, 

00:49:22.317 --> 00:49:24.278
are all in this pan. 

00:49:24.278 --> 00:49:27.958
Scrapping up all those little toasted, 

00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:32.038
stuck on goodies and dissolving them.

00:49:38.918 --> 00:49:41.876
I'll take that to the table as it is, 

00:49:41.876 --> 00:49:46.077
just spruce him up a bit. 

00:49:46.077 --> 00:49:48.876
Great flavours and it smells wonderful. 

00:49:48.876 --> 00:49:51.876
It smells like a good time. 

00:49:51.876 --> 00:49:54.278
A very, very good time. 

00:50:04.117 --> 00:50:06.557
This roast duck is as special to me now 

00:50:06.557 --> 00:50:09.356
as that boil-in-the-bag duck was when I was a kid. 

00:50:09.356 --> 00:50:13.518
If you want to impress this Christmas Day without much effort, 

00:50:13.518 --> 00:50:16.038
this handsome bird is the one to cook. 

00:50:34.438 --> 00:50:37.998
Christmas day dessert has to be.

00:50:37.998 --> 00:50:41.679
and definitely a family favourite. 

00:50:41.679 --> 00:50:43.998
It's the perfect time to have a bit of fun... 

00:50:46.438 --> 00:50:49.836
..whether it's lighting the Christmas.

00:50:49.836 --> 00:50:53.117
or creating a majestic cheese board... 

00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:57.038
for me, the meal has to end on a food high. 

00:51:03.478 --> 00:51:08.958
My final dish for Christmas Day is the most special of all. 

00:51:10.557 --> 00:51:14.798
This is my luxurious twist on the classic Christmas Day trifle. 

00:51:14.798 --> 00:51:18.998
The secret is a homemade sponge base. 

00:51:18.998 --> 00:51:23.396
The lovely thing is, that if you make your own cake for a trifle... 

00:51:25.038 --> 00:51:27.518
..you can flavour it with whatever you like. 

00:51:28.679 --> 00:51:32.798
The sponge doesn't have to be fancy. I use a basic recipe 

00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:36.038
that I then add something festive to, at the end. 

00:51:37.317 --> 00:51:42.159
So firstly, butter and caster.

00:51:44.597 --> 00:51:46.159
Then some eggs, 

00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:49.998
followed by a mixture of plain flour and ground almonds, 

00:51:49.998 --> 00:51:53.278
all mixed together until soft.

00:51:54.836 --> 00:51:58.356
Then I can start adding those extra festive flavours. 

00:51:58.356 --> 00:52:01.759
I've only got to stick my thumbnail into a.

00:52:01.759 --> 00:52:04.679
and suddenly it's this time of year again. 

00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:07.159
It doesn't matter when I do it, 

00:52:07.159 --> 00:52:11.438
it just reminds me... of cold, frosty days. 

00:52:11.438 --> 00:52:12.518
When I was a kid, 

00:52:12.518 --> 00:52:16.159
these used to come wrapped in.

00:52:16.159 --> 00:52:18.478
and bits of white tissue. 

00:52:18.478 --> 00:52:20.798
Now they just come in a net bag, 

00:52:20.798 --> 00:52:24.759
but they're still a wonderful.

00:52:24.759 --> 00:52:28.557
The juice can go in, as well. Go easy, though - 

00:52:28.557 --> 00:52:30.478
too much will make the cake mix wet. 

00:52:30.478 --> 00:52:33.998
I want this trifle to have the essence of Christmas about it, 

00:52:33.998 --> 00:52:36.199
and Clementine zest is not enough. 

00:52:37.356 --> 00:52:40.239
I'm actually going to put a bit of mincemeat in it. 

00:52:40.239 --> 00:52:44.159
It's one of those bits in the fridge that's leftover from the mince pies, 

00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:46.518
and it's such a delicious.

00:52:46.518 --> 00:52:50.518
It always saddens me that it's used for such a short time each year. 

00:52:51.759 --> 00:52:56.077
Those wonderful dried fruits and sugar and citrus that's in there. 

00:52:56.077 --> 00:53:01.719
It fills the kitchen with the most amazing smell when it's baking. 

00:53:01.719 --> 00:53:06.798
Then that goes in the oven at 180 for about 35 minutes. 

00:53:14.679 --> 00:53:16.557
While the cake's baking, 

00:53:16.557 --> 00:53:20.836
I use the time to make the rest of my Christmas trifle 

00:53:20.836 --> 00:53:22.478
even more special. 

00:53:22.478 --> 00:53:24.836
I like my trifles to have layers... 

00:53:26.998 --> 00:53:30.278
..but I'm not keen on a layer of jelly. 

00:53:30.278 --> 00:53:33.077
I did when I was about nine, 

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:37.478
but NOW I want a layer of something a bit more.

00:53:37.478 --> 00:53:41.117
What I do is to make a homemade curd. 

00:53:42.278 --> 00:53:47.239
I could buy it - there's some really good orange and lemon curds.

00:53:47.239 --> 00:53:48.679
but I like making my own. 

00:53:51.117 --> 00:53:54.518
I think the little kitchen tasks that I love the best 

00:53:54.518 --> 00:53:57.438
are the ones that make the kitchen smell heavenly. 

00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:03.759
Marmalade making, baking a cake, 

00:54:03.759 --> 00:54:07.356
even making a piece of toast... I love the smell. 

00:54:07.356 --> 00:54:10.117
It's homely and it's warm and it's friendly, 

00:54:10.117 --> 00:54:13.038
and it brings everybody into.

00:54:13.038 --> 00:54:14.679
"Oh, what are you making?" 

00:54:18.239 --> 00:54:21.199
To turn my zest and juice into a delicious curd, 

00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:23.639
I heat it gently over a pan of simmering.

00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:26.518
along with some sugar and butter. 

00:54:30.396 --> 00:54:34.159
Once that's melted, some whisked eggs go in slowly. 

00:54:37.478 --> 00:54:39.759
I'm just going to keep an eye on this. 

00:54:39.759 --> 00:54:45.077
It doesn't need constant stirring, but you don't want it to curdle. 

00:54:49.159 --> 00:54:54.239
While the curd thickens, I can get on with assembling my trifle. 

00:54:54.239 --> 00:54:57.679
The cooled mincemeat cake gets broken up for the base, 

00:54:57.679 --> 00:54:59.557
then I usually add a dash of.

00:54:59.557 --> 00:55:02.798
- I know in our family, there was always...  - CORK POPS 

00:55:02.798 --> 00:55:06.719
..almost a challenge to see how much booze you could get into a trifle. 

00:55:06.719 --> 00:55:10.117
I just don't think it does any favours at all 

00:55:10.117 --> 00:55:13.356
to stick in gallons of sherry or brandy. 

00:55:13.356 --> 00:55:17.038
You just want a light flavour of alcohol. 

00:55:18.876 --> 00:55:23.159
I have to have custard. But this bit I'm happy to cheat - 

00:55:23.159 --> 00:55:25.038
with a good ready-made one. 

00:55:32.356 --> 00:55:37.958
I've taken this to the point where it's on the verge of thickening. 

00:55:39.478 --> 00:55:42.438
Take this over to somewhere.

00:55:42.438 --> 00:55:45.597
and then as it starts to cool, it'll thicken, 

00:55:45.597 --> 00:55:49.278
and it just needs the occasional stir. 

00:55:49.278 --> 00:55:51.759
Make sure the curd is fridge-cold 

00:55:51.759 --> 00:55:54.876
before pouring over the cake and.

00:55:54.876 --> 00:55:58.798
That gets a final chill, just while I whip up some fresh cream. 

00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:11.438
For me, the real glory of a trifle is when you dig your spoon in 

00:56:11.438 --> 00:56:15.557
and you get a little bit of all of the layers mixed together... 

00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:18.918
..and they all swirl into one. 

00:56:18.918 --> 00:56:21.998
Decorate your trifle however you.

00:56:21.998 --> 00:56:25.317
it has to be colourful and fresh, so Clementine zest, 

00:56:25.317 --> 00:56:30.597
pistachios and something that will.

00:56:30.597 --> 00:56:36.396
It's just...rather fun to have something on there... 

00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:40.518
maybe a little bit different, that not.

00:56:40.518 --> 00:56:42.958
some caped gooseberries. 

00:56:51.719 --> 00:56:55.876
The kitchen is full of the most magical smells of baking, 

00:56:55.876 --> 00:57:00.876
of mincemeat, of lemon curd and of.

00:57:02.998 --> 00:57:05.518
No trifle, no celebration. 

00:57:13.518 --> 00:57:16.438
Trust me, this is the most magnificent trifle 

00:57:16.438 --> 00:57:17.719
you will ever make! 

00:57:17.719 --> 00:57:21.278
It never fails to add sparkle and glamour to my Christmas Day. 

00:57:21.278 --> 00:57:22.679
Even if you do cheat a bit, 

00:57:22.679 --> 00:57:25.518
the results will still look and taste.

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:47.159
Christmas just wouldn't be the same without something.

00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:50.356
Cooking up a handsome Christmas feast, 

00:57:50.356 --> 00:57:52.597
adding a festive twist to a.

00:57:52.597 --> 00:57:55.038
or just treating yourself to.

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.396
I, for one, love every dish. 

00:58:00.278 --> 00:58:03.478
And whether it's baking gingerbread men for the tree, 

00:58:03.478 --> 00:58:06.317
finding out what Santa's delivered, 

00:58:06.317 --> 00:58:11.239
or going that extra mile over dinner for.

00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:14.518
I really do believe that it's the simple things 

00:58:14.518 --> 00:58:17.679
that make for a truly magical.

00:58:17.679 --> 00:58:20.077
- CORK POPS  - Woo! 

00:58:20.077 --> 00:58:22.639
- Cheers! - ALL: Cheers!  - Merry Christmas! 

00:58:33.038 --> 00:58:36.998
- Sumptuous!  - Thank you so much.

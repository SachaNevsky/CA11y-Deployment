00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.640
Hello, you're watching The One Show,
live on BBC One and iPlayer.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.879
With Alex Jones
and JB Gill.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.359
Now as it's Wednesday,
Matt's in for Watchdog.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.480
And if you're one of the millions
of people watching with a pension,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.679
you'll want to listen up.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.839
Yes, I'll be telling
you about the pension provider

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.559
that's left some customers locked
out of their life savings.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.640
Plus, our inbox was inundated
on Easter Monday with complaints

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280
about a cancelled P&O cruise that
let people know just 24

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.640
hours before departure.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.240
We'll be telling you how to claim
back costs if you're

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.560
left out of pocket.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.840
Thanks, Matt, that's coming
up in just a moment.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560
Also tonight - we'll be joined
by Max Beesley and newcomer

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.079
Edison Alcaide who star
in a new thought provoking drama

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.320
called Suspect: The Shooting
of Jean Charles de Menezes.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.439
Set 20 years ago, in the aftermath
of the 7/7 bombings,

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.840
it focuses on the real life events
that led to an innocent young

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.439
man being fatally shot
on the London Underground

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.280
after he was mistaken
for a terrorist.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.439
Max and Edison will be telling us
what it was like to bring

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.719
such a powerful story
to the small screen.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.000
And joining us later in the show
is Oscar nominated actor

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.079
Dame Imelda Staunton
and her daughter Bessie Carter -

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.400
who'll you know from Bridgerton -
as they prepare to take to the stage

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.719
for the first time playing
a mother and daughter.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.680
Plus, we're heading to the stunning
Scottish Borders where artist

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.439
Adebanji Alade meets legendary
children's TV presenter

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.799
Timmy Mallett to find out
how his late brother

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.519
inspired him to paint.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:46.560
Martin was never defined by his
language and learning difficulties,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.719
he was never held back by downs
syndrome, he would say,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.640
you and me, I'm happy.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.120
What that means is
being in the moment.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.519
Such a heart-warming film,
you won't want to miss that!

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.719
But first, it's Matt for Watchdog
with that story about pensions.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.840
Yes, it's meant to be your ticket
to retirement, the pot of gold

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.080
at the end of your working rainbow.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.879
So finding out you can't access it?

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.520
Well, it's not just frustrating,
it can put your plans on pause.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.879
Imagine that there's
cash in your account,

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.000
but you can't access it
through no fault of your own.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.599
Well, that's what some customers
of one of the country's largest

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.039
pension providers have been
experiencing over

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.199
the last few months.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.639
Aegon boasts around 4 million
customers across the UK.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.759
One of them is Beyata,
a self-employed cake

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.159
maker from Brighton.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.919
I started a pension 20 years ago,
so I didn't pay too much attention.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.759
Now I'm becoming 57 and I would
like to exit my money.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.879
Wanting to use the money to buy
a property, Beyata tried to log

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.560
into her Aegon account to check how
much she had saved.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
But she hit a brick wall.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.599
I want to know how much
I've got in the pot.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.400
You would like to see how
you want to exit, the tax you pay.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.560
So when you go in, what do you find?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.759
Well, nothing at the moment.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.479
The website isn't working.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.159
Confused, Beyata called up
Aegon customer services

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.120
who told her the website was down.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.240
Instead, she was sent an online form
and was assured she would get

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.639
a response within five working days.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.439
But she didn't hear anything.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.560
There is no phone call,
there is no letter.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.599
There's nothing.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.439
Instead, took Aegon 18 days
to send Beyata a letter,

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.080
telling her she had over £22,000
in her pension savings pot

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520
and explaining how to withdraw it.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.400
But despite repeated attempts,
she still couldn't get

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.159
access to her money.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.960
What is the communication
with Aegon at the moment?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.439
There is no communication,
only the letter we've received.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.080
I'm waiting.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.039
What does this mean for you,
Beyata, and your family?

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.240
It affects me hugely
because obviously you find

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.840
a property, but I can't exchange
so I'm waiting for it.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.039
So it's very, very frustrating.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.199
Beyata's case is just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.400
There are loads of complaints online
from disgruntled customers.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240
Since the start of the year,
58% of Aegon reviews on Trustpilot

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.199
have ranked just one star.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.680
The customers we've heard
from haven't been given a timeframe

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.079
for when they will be able
to access their money.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.759
And in our research we also heard
that it is affecting

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.920
people who don't even hold
an account with them.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600
Eight months ago, self-employed
tradesman Gary decided

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.000
to leave Aegon having been
with the providers since 2010.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.560
However, he discovered three
contributions of £778 had been

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.519
taken from him by Aegon
after closing his account.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:47.519
So Gary complained to the company.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.160
Then they came back and said
we shouldn't have taken it.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.399
It can take a little while to sort
out, possibly 28 days.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.120
But 28 days later, there
was still no sign of the £2300.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.560
When you explained what was
happening, what did they say?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.360
When I rang up I said could be
a week or could it be six months?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.560
Sorry, there is no timescale.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.199
But despite making regular calls
to Aegon there was still no

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.240
sign of Gary's cash.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.680
Just continually ringing
their customer service.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.639
Very frustrating.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.519
And I just feel you're banging your
head against a brick wall.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.639
Two years ago a new set of rules
was introduced known as consumer

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.040
duty which requires FCA regulated
firms to prove they deliver

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.079
good customer outcomes.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.240
If they don't, they can
be hit with penalties.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.240
James Daly is from the financial
research group Fairer Finance.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.879
It doesn't sound like Aegon has done
enough at this point.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.079
Customers seem
incredibly frustrated.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:47.319
They've been made promises
which Aegon didn't keep.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.439
If they were seen to be stalling
and not doing what was best

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.120
for their customers,
then penalties would be

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.000
even greater for them.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.600
To say we are going to have this
sorted in a few days and then

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.759
continually let customers down,
just adds insult to injury.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.199
We asked Aegon for a comment.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.839
It sincerely apologised
for any frustration

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:08.079
and inconvenience caused.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.959
It said that a technology upgrade
left a small number of customers

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.360
experiencing issues which may have
led to delays in service.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.120
But that no one would be financially
disadvantaged as a result.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.079
Aegon assured us that its customers'
money is safe and secure

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.240
and that its executive team
is working to improve

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.480
customer experience.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.120
After we got in touch,
Aegon did reimburse Gary his £2300

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.519
and Beyata successfully cashed
out her pension pot, with both

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.720
receiving gestures of goodwill.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.040
Aegon, you've been trusted to look
after people's money.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.399
So don't let them down when,
after years, they need

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:48.800
to access their funds.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.040
You really feel for them.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.720
t's so frustrating when you've got
money that you just can't access.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.600
Absolutely, Al.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.480
And if you feel you've been treated
unfairly by a pension provider,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.759
or any company for that matter,
get in touch.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.040
watchdog@bbc.co.uk,
@BBCWatchdog on the socials.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.439
Another company that's back
in our inbox is Klarna,

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.720
the buy now pay later service.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.639
Last year, we told you how
fraudulent accounts

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.160
were being set
up in people's names.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.639
At the time, Klarna told us it had

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.240
industry-leading fraud prevention
methods in place to protect users.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.160
I'm guessing that those
measures haven't held up?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.399
You got it, JB.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.279
We've heard from a number of people
who say fraudulent Klarna accounts

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.399
have been set up in their name
and now they're left with hundreds

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:34.600
of pounds worth of debt.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.439
Take Craig.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.920
Al, hit it.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.759
Craig received a letter from Klarna
issuing a final demand

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.680
for a payment of £495,
but he hadn't used

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.800
Klarna since 2023.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.680
Once he checked his credit score
and discovered it was affected,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.079
he contacted Klarna who confirmed
someone had indeed set up

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.560
an account in his name.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.639
Sadly Craig isn't alone.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.959
JB, tell us about Carl.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:06.360
He discovered he had
a Klarna account in his name

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.759
with a debt of over £600,
even though he's never

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:09.800
been a customer.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.680
He told Klarna it couldn't possibly
have been him making the purchases

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.319
as he was with his family in Canada
at the time.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.959
Yes, and he's since had calls
from a debt collection agency,

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.439
which has taken a big toll on him.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.680
It's really frustrating
and incredibly stressful.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.279
I'm looking to buy a house
later in the year.

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.680
And the idea of something
like this putting a spanner

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.399
in the works is unbearable.

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:32.120
That must be so stressful.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.080
What has Klarna said about this?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Klarna says the fraudsters
would have already had compromised

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.399
data to open these accounts,
but it is really sorry for how

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:46.840
these cases were handled.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.240
It says a stronger verification
process has now been introduced

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.360
meaning customers will have to take
a live selfie along with a photo

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.039
of their ID if fraud is suspected.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.799
And what about Craig and Carl?

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:58.679
Klarna recognises that it didn't act
quick enough to resolve the issues

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.799
and since we got involved they both
have now had their debts removed

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:05.720
along with any marks
on their credit reports.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:13.679
What a result for Watchdog!

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.080
Thank you, studio!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.480
Hopefully Klarna will clear up
any other similar cases just

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.399
as quickly without needing
a nudge from us.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.840
Let us know if they don't.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.600
Now on Easter Monday,
whilst most people were still

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.519
working through their eggs,
our inbox was chock-a-block.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.679
We received over 50 complaints
after P&O Cruises cancelled

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:36.440
its Southampton to Zeebrugge cruise
around 24 hours before departure.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.200
The reason?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.399
A last-minute delay
to the ship's refit.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:43.559
Understandably people aren't happy.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.480
And when I say people, I mean Mary.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.159
JB, tell us something about Mary?

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:50.080
Mary planned to go
cruising with her friends.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.519
Her husband even took time off work
to look after the dogs.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.440
She says only one
of the group received

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.639
the cancellation email on Sunday

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.039
and when they phoned customer
services on Monday they said

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.720
the advisor didn't know
anything about it.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.080
Yes, they thought it was all a scam
until P&O phoned them back hours

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:14.039
before the ship was due to board
confirming the cancellation.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:24.360
Did they explain why it was so late?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.799
They offered discount on another
cruise but many have said, not

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.519
likely and there are also additional
costs like insurance and parking and

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.799
time taken off work for dog care.
What should people do in that

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:45.759
situation?

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.559
Hold the cruise company to account.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.240
It's the one that took your money.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.120
If the ship's not available then
it's got to sort you out.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.759
Only then should you go
to your insurer, because of course,

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.919
if you have to claim,
you could see your

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.120
premiums go up next time.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.759
Which made us worry about tomorrow,
when The Aurora is off

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:01.960
to Norway for 12 nights.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.120
P&O say she's ship-shape
and Bristol fashion,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.559
pining for the fjords.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:11.200
If you're Oslo-bound on the Aurora,
still no harm in checking

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.000
before leaving the house.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.600
Send us a postcard of
the Northern Lights!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.240
Thanks, Matt.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.679
Lots of great advice as always.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.480
Still to come tonight,
acting royalty Dame Imelda Staunton

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.000
will be here alongside her daughter,
Bridgerton star Bessie Carter,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.440
as they tell us about playing
a mother and daughter

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.759
who don't see eye to eye.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:38.399
But first, we're talking
about a powerful new drama out next

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.120
week called Suspect: The shooting
of Jean Charles De Menezes.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.360
Set in London in 2005,
it focuses on the events that

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.960
surrounded the tragic killing
of an innocent man at Stockwell tube

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:55.919
station after he was
mistaken for a terrorist.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:00.639
Before we speak to actors
Max Beesley and Edison Alcaide -

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:01.840
who plays Jean Charles -

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.240
let's take a look.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.519
July 7th, we've never seen
anything like it before.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:14.559
The most significant attack on Kabul
the Second World War. 
We should

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:18.240
assume that the people who did this
will try again. 
This needs decisive

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.480
action. 
He has entered the station.
There is no doubt that the man shot

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.080
yesterday has no connections to
terrorism.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.720
And joining us now is Max Beesley
and Edison Alcaide!

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.480
This is such a powerful drama.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:45.399
We have both been lucky enough to
see a preview. It really takes you

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:52.919
back to how tense we were as a
nation at that time. 
I do remember

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:58.960
exactly where I was at that time and
the show itself starts in the

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.679
aftermath of the first bombings
which resulted in I think 52 deaths

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:10.919
and almost 800 injuries. So we are
right in the deep end of the start

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:17.159
of the show. But I remember on the
day we were doing a run through for

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:21.960
the show at nine o'clock and the
producer said we should start at

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.679
8:30am. So we are all heading in an
hour earlier than we should have

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:31.120
been but we were all on that
infrastructure and then we were

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.679
hearing sirens and thinking what on
earth is going on and of course we

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:39.080
know now what a tragedy it was. 
I
think everyone remembers where they

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.320
were.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.639
were. After the original bombings
who had second-rate failed bombings.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:51.279
which led to a huge manhunt
which Jean Charles de Menezes

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.320
was accidently drawn into.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.840
How did he get caught up in this?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:05.840
So many different factors and so
many errors. And obviously no luck

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.120
as well, a combination of
everything. But this is just the man

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.480
who was living in London, Brazilian
man living completely innocent and

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:21.440
just trying to make ends meet. Just
like everyone else. 
It is so tragic

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:29.639
and that is portrayed really well in
the drama.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.080
The drama is told from
multiple perspectives.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.120
Including Andy Hayman

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.799
who oversees the investigations
into the bombings.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:43.000
You play him and had
the opportunity to meet him.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.039
I asked the producers on the show if
it was possible to get in touch with

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:52.840
him and I had read before I knew I
was going to do the job, he had a

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.879
book out which was a great read and
I'd read it a few times and started

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:01.919
to get a sense of the man and what
he was like as an operator in the

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.600
police force. He was an incredible
high achiever and immense

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.799
professional and very good and at
the top of his game but to actually

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:15.919
get time with him was invaluable
because you can get a measure of the

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:19.519
man. You're trying to find the soul
of someone and of course not trying

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:23.639
to do impressions of people but from
the practicalities of dialect and

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:27.879
movement and hand gestures and
within the confines of the script

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:33.120
just to get that time with him and
he was generous with me. And we

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.440
started off quite light for the
first hour and then got into some

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.720
quite pertinent questions and he was
very forthcoming. That was

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.000
invaluable.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.200
You worked closely with the family
of Jean Charles de Menezes, you are

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.600
both Brazilian, but aside from that
you felt that there were some real

00:15:52.600 --> 00:16:00.120
similarities between the two of you.
Absolutely. Jean Charles are

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.000
somebody I could see myself in. I
felt like I really connected with

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.039
Jean Charles on so many levels. It
is very meaningful to me, as well,

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:20.000
because he is a Brazilian guy living
in London, you know? 
This is

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.600
Edison's first big role alongside
yourself, Max, and Daniel Mays and

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.720
Russell Derby, you must be very
proud of him. 
Yes, when you look at

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.200
this horrific tragedy we only have
documents, we can look at the

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.799
descriptions of Jean Charles and so
on, but for a drama like this and

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:47.240
for Edison to play it like this, it
was so truthful and so beautiful,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:54.919
actually, at the press screening at
the Bafta, I was sat next to Laura,

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:59.759
and we couldn't actually breed, we
were struggling to hold it together

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:03.559
and to humanise Jean Charles and to
portray him as best as you can as

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:10.599
you did -- could not actually
breathe. It is powerful to put that

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:15.400
drama into peoples houses and give
them multiples perspectives and to

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.519
see a living version of Jean Charles
as himself betrayed by Edison so

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:25.279
beautifully, it is vital to connect
with people, if that makes sense. 
It

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:31.240
really was. It is a really important
show, and done so well.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:40.119
Congratulations on your
performances. You can watch Suspect

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:41.759
on Disney+ from next Wednesday.

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:44.720
And details of organisations
offering help and support

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.319
In just a moment Dame Imelda
Staunton and Bessie Carter will be

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.839
here to tell us about taking
on their most personal role to date.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.839
But now, we're heading
to the Scottish Borders with artist

00:17:56.839 --> 00:18:02.680
Adebanji Alade to visit one
of the UK's most striking landmarks.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.799
And joining him is a familiar face
whose artwork is as colourful

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.319
This landscape is stunning.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.119
And I'm not here by chance.

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:11.799
This spot has been chosen
by someone

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.279
whose wacky sense of humour

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:22.240
kept a whole
generation of kids laughing.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:27.200
Mallet's Mallett is
a word association game.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.720
You must pause.
You mustn't hesitate.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.599
Otherwise you get back
your head like this.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.680
Or like this.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.799
Timmy Mallett, he's asked me
to meet him here

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.720
at the foot of the magnificent
Leaderfoot Viaduct

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.880
in the Scottish Borders,
because nowadays he's more likely

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.759
to be wielding a paintbrush rather
than his iconic big foam mallet.

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:43.960
Here he comes.
Oh, my days.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.759
Adebanji!

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:47.359
Timmy!
What an honour.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:50.960
Tell me, why are we here?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.359
And when I'm not entertaining
with Mallett's mallet,

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:56.319
I'm The Cycling Artist.
And I pedal everywhere.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:59.799
And I paint pictures
everywhere I go.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:03.640
Now it makes sense,
because this place is stunning.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.039
We're setting up our easels
so I can paint him

00:19:06.039 --> 00:19:11.400
while he captures
a picture of the landscape.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.160
Southern Scotland is a hidden gem.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.799
People tend to dash past on their
way to the Highlands, and really,

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:24.160
they're missing a trick because
this really has so much to offer.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.000
This viaduct was an old railway line
which ran for 80 years.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.920
The last Indiana Jones
film was shot here.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.480
Wow.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:41.440
It's a great location
and it's attracting all sorts,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.640
including great
artists like Adebaji.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.920
Joking aside, Timmy's
set up is pretty unusual.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.680
Timmy, I have never seen
an easel on a bike.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.359
I wanted to find a way
to paint on the bike,

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:06.000
so I've worked out a way of
attaching the easel onto the bike.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.920
I painted the bike myself
with water-based paints.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.119
It's part and parcel of who I am.

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:14.720
In 1984, Timmy joined
children's TV show Wide Awake Club

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.599
and later went on to present
Wacaday, which ran until 1992.

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:21.240
What do you think of the shorts?
Do you like them?

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.640
His face and catchphrases were known
by an entire generation.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.839
Bash my head like this.

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:25.880
Or like this.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.519
Utterly brilliant.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.680
But more recently, art has become
a full-time occupation.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.960
Timmy, have you always
been an artist?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.920
Oh, yeah.
Art's been essential in our family.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.759
My dad, he was an artist.
He would say, "Sharpen your eyes".

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.799
Look closely at things
and let the light and shade

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.759
build up the picture.

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:53.119
And we'd always have
a great critic in my mum.

00:20:53.119 --> 00:21:01.079
Oh!

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.319
"Mum, what do you think
of my painting?"

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:09.720
She would say...

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.359
"Very nice, dear.
I prefer the frame."

00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.799
In 2018, Timmy set off on

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.720
a 2500-mile painting
and cycling trip around Europe.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.160
It's a long way to Santiago!

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.799
His inspiration was
his brother Martin.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:18.839
Martin had Down's Syndrome


00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:22.559
and he died shortly
before Timmy set off.

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:26.480
Martin was never defined by his
language and learning difficulties.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:34.440
He was never held back
by Down's Syndrome.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.400
He would say, "You
and me, I'm happy."

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.319
What that means is being
in the moment

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.960
and to be in the moment
is easy on the bike.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.759
Dear Martin shows me that,

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:47.079
have a go,

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:50.240
try your best to
reach your potential.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.680
See if you can.
Every day.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.000
Wonderful.
What a spirit.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And you know what, Adebanji?
I'm done.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.079
All right, I'm gonna come
and see yours first.

00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:01.720
Oh, wow.
I love it.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.799
The contrast in the light
hitting these pillars.

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:05.960
You have these silhouetted
ones against the sky,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.640
and then, boom, the light comes out.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.039
Wonderful.
Brilliant.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.480
Thanks.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.160
Brilliant.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.839
Shall we have a look at yours?

00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:16.519
OK.
Right.

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.799
I recognise that fella.

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.880
Yeah.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.880
There's some colour
in this, isn't there?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.359
Yeah.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.160
It represents what you do, how you
do it and what you do it with. 
Thank

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:43.119
you, that is utterly, utterly
brilliant. 
Thank you.

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:51.039
brilliant. 
Thank you. Both paintings
are so lovely. I used to love

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:55.160
watching Timmy Mallett.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.079
Time to say hello
to our next guests.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:02.599
They're two actors who also happen
to share a family tree.

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:08.920
It's Dame Imelda Staunton
and her daughter  Bessie Carter.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.039
I'm in the presence of acting
royalty, because you have just won

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:20.680
your fifth Olivier Award, amazing,
how do you feel? 
Greedy! Still

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:27.480
greedy. It is very nice, yes. You
are not going to get much more out

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:37.400
of me on that. 
You two now, mother
and daughter on

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.440
and daughter on stage in Mrs
Warren's Profession, set in

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.079
Victorian times, and when it was
first written, it is about the

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:49.039
contentious relationship between the
pair, and then a secret is revealed

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:56.079
that changes things.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.200
that changes things. 
Yes, it focuses
on a mother and daughter who have

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.920
been somewhat estranged and have not
known each other due to their

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.200
circumstances. We meet them over
these few days when they have a sort

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.599
of confrontation of sorts which
neither of them want to have but

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:19.680
they have to have. 
And to have a
play that is written in 1893, about

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.119
the plight of women either in the
workplace or at home or just in

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:28.240
life, that women yet again are not
treated equally, and George Bernard

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.039
Shaw was a great champion of women,
and this play was a band, because

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:36.359
they didn't want to know. It was
partly banned because of the title.

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:48.720
You have a woman having a title, not
acceptable. 
Not cool at the time.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.119
Now, you start alongside your mum,
Bessie, and this is your first time

00:24:53.119 --> 00:25:00.799
starring alongside her, how does it
feel? 
Terrible, awful! We were both

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:08.000
having a terrible time!

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:10.359
having a terrible time! It is really
great. It is a real treat. We are

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:17.079
having a lovely time. It feels
weirdly, almost burly, to us,

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:22.680
normal, and be just our two actors
in a space trying to tell a story,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.880
so it is a real treat. 
And the
packed lunches are really good. 
That

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.359
is all we talk about! You have the
hard-boiled eggs for the 11 o'clock

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:45.079
break, and then we compare stuff.
Living the dream! Add your dad as an

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:48.720
actor, you have directed him before,
is it good to working with family,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.599
or not so much? 
When you get into
that region when you're on the

00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:57.680
floor, working with each other, the
relationship, the father and son

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.680
with my father, you trust each
other, I will give him a note, and

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.400
he would go OK and get up and do it,
but it was a brilliant thing for him

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.440
to let me direct, it is a brilliant
short, and he is wonderful in it. I

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.799
am really glad that I actually did
that, I have something that is

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:21.200
tangible with my father and I that I
can look at and show his

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.440
grandchildren years down the line.
It was a great experience. 
Really

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.279
special, isn't it? And you said that
you had not performed together

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:34.279
before, but then we found this
photo, and we wondered what was

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:45.680
going on. 
This was a rendition of
Mamma Mia!!. 
It was last week!

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.839
Started young.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.279
Started young. 
Dorking family,
Edison, what did your family say

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:59.119
when you wanted to pursue acting as
a career? -- talking family. 
My

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:03.880
parents were always really
supportive but cautiously

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.640
supportive, they told me, OK, good,
have a Plan B, C and D, and get a

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:17.880
degree. 
Did you? 
I did. I actually
studied here in the UK, at

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.880
university, but I went for film
production. It was a way of sort of

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.200
like losing my parents but also
still being involved somehow in

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:35.359
film. 
They must be proud now,
though. I totally understand that.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:43.599
And lots of rumours flying around
about the celebrity Traitors

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:47.240
Sentences, And Celia Imrie Is
Rumoured To Be One Of Them, Will She

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.680
Make A Good Traitor? 
She Is An
Actress, I Dare Say She Will Make A

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.640
Brilliant Traitor, I Cannot Think Of
Anyone Better. 
We watch traitors and

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.680
it is hilarious, and I think she
would be a great asset to that

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.559
house.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.759
house. 
Mrs Walker's profession opens
on the 22nd of May at the Garrick

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:17.759
Theatre in London and is on until
the 16th of August.

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:23.519
the 16th of August. -- Mrs Warren's
Profession. This would definitely

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:29.359
give the

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.519
give the cast the heebeegeebees! A
big thank you to all of our guests

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:35.079
and to Matthew Bostock.

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.599
That's all we've got
time for tonight.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:40.039
I'll be back tomorrow with Roman
when we'll be joined

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:41.920
by the stars of Thunderbolts,
Florence Pugh and

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.119
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
alongside Jeremy Vine.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:45.519
Plus, KSI gives out
a special One Big Thank You.

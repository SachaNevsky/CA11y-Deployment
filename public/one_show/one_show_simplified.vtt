00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.640
Hello. You are watching The One Show.
It's live on BBC One and iPlayer.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.879
With Alex Jones and JB Gill.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.359
It is Wednesday, so Matt is here for Watchdog.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.480
If you are one of the many people watching who has a pension,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.679
you should listen.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.839
Yes, I will tell you about the pension company

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.559
that locked some people out of their savings.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.640
Also, we got lots of emails on Easter Monday about

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280
a P&O cruise that was cancelled. They told people only 24

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.640
hours before the trip.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.240
We will tell you how to get your money back if you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.560
lost money.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.840
Thanks, Matt. That is coming soon.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560
Also tonight, Max Beesley and new actor

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.079
Edison Alcaide will join us. They are in a new drama that makes you think.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.320
It is called Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.439
It is set 20 years ago, after the 7/7 bombs.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.840
It is about the real things that led to a young man

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.439
who did nothing wrong being shot dead on the London Underground

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.280
because they thought he was a bad guy.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.439
Max and Edison will tell us what it was like to bring

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.719
such a strong story to TV.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.000
Later in the show, Oscar-nominated actor

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.079
Dame Imelda Staunton and her daughter Bessie Carter will join us.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.400
You know Bessie from Bridgerton. They will act on stage

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.719
for the first time playing a mother and daughter.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.680
Also, we go to the lovely Scottish Borders where artist

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.439
Adebanji Alade meets famous kids' TV host

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.799
Timmy Mallett to learn how his brother who passed away

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.519
made him want to paint.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:46.560
Martin was not held back by his problems with talking and learning.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.719
He was not held back by Down's syndrome. He would say,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.640
"You and me, I'm happy."

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.120
That means enjoy right now.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.519
It's a very nice film. You will want to see that!

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.719
But first, Matt is here for Watchdog with the story about pensions.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.840
Yes, it is supposed to be your money for when you stop working. Like finding gold

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.080
at the end of a rainbow after working hard.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.879
So finding out you cannot get it?

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.520
Well, it is not just annoying. It can stop your plans.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.879
Think about having money in your account,

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.000
but you cannot get it, and it is not your fault.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.599
Well, that is what some people who use one of the biggest

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.039
pension companies have felt

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.199
over the last few months.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.639
Aegon says it has about 4 million customers in the UK.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.759
One of them is Beyata. She works for herself

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.159
making cakes in Brighton.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.919
I started a pension 20 years ago. I did not pay much attention to it.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.759
Now I am turning 57 and I want to take my money out.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.879
Beyata wanted to use the money to buy a house. She tried to log

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.560
into her Aegon account to see how much she had saved.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
But she could not get in.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.599
I want to know how much money I have.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.400
You want to see how to take it out, and the tax you pay.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.560
So when you go in, what do you find?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.759
Well, nothing right now.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.479
The website does not work.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.159
Beyata was confused. She called Aegon customer service.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.120
They told her the website was not working.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.240
Instead, they sent her an online form. They promised she would get

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.639
an answer in five work days.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.439
But she heard nothing back.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.560
There was no phone call. There was no letter.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.599
There was nothing.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.439
Instead, it took Aegon 18 days to send Beyata a letter.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.080
It said she had over £22,000 in her pension savings.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520
It told her how to take it out.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.400
But she tried many times and still could not

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.159
get her money.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.960
How are you talking with Aegon right now?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.439
There is no talking, only the letter we got.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.080
I'm waiting.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.039
What does this mean for you, Beyata, and your family?

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.240
It affects me a lot because you find

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.840
a house, but I cannot buy it. So I'm waiting.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.039
So it is very, very upsetting.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.199
Beyata's problem is not the only one.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.400
There are lots of complaints online from unhappy customers.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240
Since the year started, 58% of Aegon reviews on Trustpilot

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.199
have only one star.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.680
The customers we heard from were not told a time

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.079
when they can get their money.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.759
And we also learned that it is affecting

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.920
people who do not even have an account with them.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600
Eight months ago, Gary, who works for himself, decided

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.000
to leave Aegon. He had been with them since 2010.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.560
But he found out that three payments of £778 had been

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.519
taken by Aegon after he closed his account.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:47.519
So Gary complained to the company.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.160
Then they said, "We should not have taken it."

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.399
It might take about 28 days to fix.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.120
But 28 days later, the £2300 was still not back.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.560
When you told them what was happening, what did they say?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.360
When I called, I asked if it could be a week or maybe six months?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.560
"Sorry, there is no time frame."

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.199
But even though he called Aegon often, there was still no

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.240
sign of Gary's money.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.680
Just calling their customer service again and again.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.639
Very annoying.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.519
And I just feel like you are hitting your head on a wall.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.639
Two years ago, new rules started. They are called consumer

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.040
duty. These rules say that companies checked by the FCA must show they give

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.079
good results for customers.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.240
If they do not, they can get fined.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.240
James Daly works for Fairer Finance, a group that studies money matters.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.879
It does not sound like Aegon has done enough yet.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.079
Customers seem very annoyed.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:47.319
Aegon made promises that they did not keep.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.439
If they seemed to be delaying and not doing what was best

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.120
for their customers, then the fines

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.000
would be even bigger for them.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.600
To say "we will fix this in a few days" and then

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.759
keep letting customers down just makes it worse.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.199
We asked Aegon to comment.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.839
It said it was very sorry for any upset

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:08.079
and trouble caused.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.959
It said that a computer update meant a few customers

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.360
had problems which might have caused slow service.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.120
But that no one would lose money because of it.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.079
Aegon promised us that its customers' money is safe

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.240
and that its bosses are working to make things better

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.480
for customers.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.120
After we contacted them, Aegon gave Gary back his £2300.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.519
And Beyata got her pension money out. Both also

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.720
got something extra to say sorry.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.040
Aegon, people trust you to look after their money.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.399
So do not let them down when, after many years, they need

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:48.800
to get their money.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.040
You really feel bad for them.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.720
It is so annoying when you have money you cannot get.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.600
Yes, Al.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.480
And if you feel a pension company treated you badly,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.759
or any company, let us know.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.040
watchdog@bbc.co.uk, @BBCWatchdog on social media.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.439
Another company we are hearing about again is Klarna,

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.720
the buy now, pay later service.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.639
Last year, we told you how fake accounts

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.160
were being made using people's names.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.639
At that time, Klarna told us it had

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.240
very good ways to stop fraud and protect users.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.160
I guess those ways have not worked?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.399
You got it, JB.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.279
We have heard from some people who say fake Klarna accounts

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.399
were made in their name. Now they owe hundreds

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:34.600
of pounds.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.439
Take Craig.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.920
Al, tell us.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.759
Craig got a letter from Klarna. It was a final warning

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.680
for a payment of £495. But he had not used

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.800
Klarna since 2023.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.680
He checked his credit score and saw it was lower.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.079
He called Klarna. They said someone had indeed made

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.560
an account using his name.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.639
Sadly, Craig is not the only one.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.959
JB, tell us about Carl.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:06.360
He found out he had a Klarna account in his name

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.759
with a debt over £600, but he has never

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:09.800
used Klarna.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.680
He told Klarna it could not have been him buying things

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.319
because he was in Canada with his family then.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.959
Yes, and since then, a company that collects debts has called him.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.439
This has caused him a lot of stress.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.680
It is really annoying and causes a lot of worry.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.279
I want to buy a house later this year.

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.680
The thought of something like this causing problems

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.399
is very bad.

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:32.120
That must be so stressful.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.080
What did Klarna say about this?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Klarna says the bad guys must have already stolen

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.399
information to open these accounts. But it is very sorry for how

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:46.840
these problems were handled.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.240
It says a better way to check who people are has been added.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.360
Now customers will have to take a live photo of themselves and a photo

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.039
of their ID if fraud might be happening.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.799
And what about Craig and Carl?

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:58.679
Klarna knows it did not act fast enough to fix the problems.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.799
Since we got involved, both have now had their debts cleared

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:05.720
and any bad marks on their credit reports removed.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:13.679
What a good result for Watchdog!

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.080
Thank you, studio!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.480
Hopefully Klarna will fix any other similar problems just

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.399
as quickly without us needing to push them.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.840
Let us know if they do not.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.600
Now on Easter Monday, while most people were still

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.519
eating their Easter eggs, our email was full.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.679
We got over 50 complaints after P&O Cruises cancelled

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:36.440
its Southampton to Zeebrugge cruise about 24 hours before it left.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.200
Why?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.399
The ship's repairs were delayed at the last minute.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:43.559
People are not happy, as you can guess.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.480
And when I say people, I mean Mary.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.159
JB, tell us about Mary?

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:50.080
Mary planned to go on the cruise with her friends.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.519
Her husband even took time off work to watch the dogs.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.440
She says only one person in the group got

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.639
the email about the cancellation on Sunday.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.039
When they called customer service on Monday, they said

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.720
the person on the phone did not know about it.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.080
Yes, they thought it was a trick until P&O called them back hours

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:14.039
before the ship was supposed to board, saying it was cancelled.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:24.360
Did they say why it was so late?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.799
They offered money off another cruise, but many said, "No way."

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.519
There are also extra costs like insurance and parking and

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.799
time taken off work for dog care. What should people do then?

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.559
Make the cruise company fix it.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.240
They took your money.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.120
If the ship is not ready, they have to help you.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.759
Only after that should you talk to your insurance, because

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.919
if you make a claim, your cost

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.120
might go up next time.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.759
This made us worry about tomorrow, when The Aurora ship goes

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:01.960
to Norway for 12 nights.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.120
P&O say she is ready to go,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.559
ready for the fjords.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:11.200
If you are going to Oslo on the Aurora, it is still good to check

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.000
before you leave home.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.600
Send us a postcard of the Northern Lights!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.240
Thanks, Matt.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.679
Lots of good advice, like always.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.480
Still coming tonight, famous actor Dame Imelda Staunton

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.000
will be here with her daughter, Bridgerton star Bessie Carter.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.440
They will tell us about playing a mother and daughter

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.759
who do not agree.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:38.399
But first, we are talking about a strong new drama out next

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.120
week called Suspect: The shooting of Jean Charles De Menezes.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.360
It is set in London in 2005. It is about the things that

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.960
happened around the sad killing of a man who did nothing wrong at Stockwell tube

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:55.919
station after they thought he was a bad guy.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:00.639
Before we talk to actors Max Beesley and Edison Alcaide -

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:01.840
who plays Jean Charles -

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.240
let's watch a clip.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.519
July 7th, we have never seen anything like it.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:14.559
The biggest attack since World War II. We should think

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:18.240
that the people who did this will try again. This needs strong

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.480
action. He has gone into the station. The man shot

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.080
yesterday was not linked to bad guys.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.720
And joining us now are Max Beesley and Edison Alcaide!

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.480
This is such a strong drama.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:45.399
We were both lucky to see it early. It really reminds you

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:52.919
how worried we all were back then. I remember

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:58.960
exactly where I was. The show starts after the first bombs

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.679
which killed 52 people, I think,

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:10.919
and hurt almost 800. So we start right in the middle of it

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:17.159
at the beginning of the show. But I remember on the day, we were practicing

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:21.960
for the show at nine o'clock. The boss said we should start at

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.679
8:30am. So we were all going in an hour earlier than planned.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:31.120
We were all using the trains and buses. Then we heard

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.679
sirens and wondered what was happening. And of course, we

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:39.080
know now how sad it was. I think everyone remembers where they

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.320
were.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.639
After the first bombs, there were more failed bomb attempts.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:51.279
This led to a big search where Jean Charles de Menezes

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.320
was accidentally involved.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.840
How did he get mixed up in this?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:05.840
So many different reasons and so many mistakes. And also bad luck,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.120
a mix of everything. But this was just a man

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.480
living in London. A man from Brazil living a normal life,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:21.440
just trying to earn money. Just like everyone else. It is so sad

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:29.639
and the drama shows that really well.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.080
The drama is told from different points of view.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.120
Including Andy Hayman,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.799
who was in charge of looking into the bombs.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:43.000
You play him and got to meet him.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.039
I asked the bosses on the show if I could talk to

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:52.840
him. Before I knew I got the job, I had read his book.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.879
It was a great book. I read it a few times and started

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:01.919
to understand the man and what he was like working in the

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.600
police force. He was very successful and very

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.799
good at his job. He was one of the best. But actually

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:15.919
getting time with him was so helpful. You can get an idea of the

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:19.519
man. You try to understand someone's spirit. You are not trying

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:23.639
to copy people, but things like how they talk,

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:27.879
how they move, hand movements, and within the words of the script,

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:33.120
just getting that time with him was great. He was open with me. We

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.440
started talking easily for the first hour. Then we asked some

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.720
important questions, and he answered them fully. That was

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.000
so helpful.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.200
You worked closely with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes. You are

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.600
both from Brazil. But besides that, you felt there were some real

00:15:52.600 --> 00:16:00.120
ways you were alike. Yes. Jean Charles is

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.000
someone I could see myself in. I felt like I really understood

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.039
Jean Charles in many ways. It is very important to me, too,

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:20.000
because he is a Brazilian guy living in London, you know? This is

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.600
Edison's first big acting job with you, Max, and Daniel Mays and

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.720
Russell Tovey. You must be very proud of him. Yes, when you look at

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.200
this terrible sad event, we only have papers. We can look at the

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.799
words about Jean Charles and so on. But for a drama like this and

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:47.240
for Edison to play him like this, it was so real and so beautiful.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:54.919
Actually, at the showing for the press at Bafta, I sat next to Laura.

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:59.759
We could hardly breathe. We were trying hard not to cry.

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:03.559
To make Jean Charles seem real and to show him as best as you can as

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:10.599
you did -- could not actually breathe. It is important to put that

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:15.400
drama in people's houses and give them different views and to

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.519
see a living version of Jean Charles shown by Edison so

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:25.279
beautifully. It is key to connect with people, if that makes sense. It

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:31.240
really was. It is a very important show, and done so well.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:40.119
Well done on your acting. You can watch Suspect

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:41.759
on Disney+ from next Wednesday.

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:44.720
And information about groups offering help and support

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.319
In a moment, Dame Imelda Staunton and Bessie Carter will be

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.839
here to tell us about acting in their most personal role yet.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.839
But now, we go to the Scottish Borders with artist

00:17:56.839 --> 00:18:02.680
Adebanji Alade to visit one of the UK's most amazing places.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.799
And joining him is someone you know whose art is as bright

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.319
This place looks amazing.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.119
And I am not here just by luck.

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:11.799
This place was chosen by someone

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.279
whose funny ways

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:22.240
made lots of kids laugh for years.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:27.200
Mallet's Mallett is a word game.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.720
You must not stop. You must not wait.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.599
Or you get hit on the head like this.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.680
Or like this.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.799
Timmy Mallett asked me to meet him here

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.720
at the bottom of the great Leaderfoot Viaduct

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.880
in the Scottish Borders. Because now he is more likely

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.759
to hold a paintbrush than his famous big foam mallet.

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:43.960
Here he comes. Oh, wow.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.759
Adebanji!

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:47.359
Timmy! It is great to meet you.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:50.960
Tell me, why are we here?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.359
When I am not being funny with Mallett's mallet,

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:56.319
I am The Cycling Artist. And I ride my bike everywhere.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:59.799
And I paint pictures everywhere I go.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:03.640
Now I understand, because this place looks great.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.039
We are setting up our stands so I can paint him

00:19:06.039 --> 00:19:11.400
while he paints a picture of the view.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.160
The south of Scotland is a secret beautiful place.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.799
People often drive past quickly on their way to the Highlands. Really,

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:24.160
they are missing out because this place has so much to see.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.000
This bridge was an old train line that ran for 80 years.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.920
The last Indiana Jones movie was filmed here.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.480
Wow.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:41.440
It is a great place and it brings all kinds of people,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.640
including great artists like Adebaji.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.920
Jokes aside, Timmy's setup is quite strange.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.680
Timmy, I have never seen a painting stand on a bike.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.359
I wanted to find a way to paint on the bike.

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:06.000
So I figured out how to attach the stand to the bike.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.920
I painted the bike myself with water paints.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.119
It is part of who I am.

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:14.720
In 1984, Timmy joined the kids' TV show Wide Awake Club.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.599
Later he hosted Wacaday, which was on until 1992.

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:21.240
What do you think of the shorts? Do you like them?

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.640
His face and sayings were known by a whole group of people.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.839
Hit my head like this.

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:25.880
Or like this.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.519
Really great.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.680
But more recently, art has become his full-time job.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.960
Timmy, have you always been an artist?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.920
Oh, yes. Art has been very important in our family.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.759
My dad was an artist. He would say, "Look closely."

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.799
Look closely at things. Let the light and dark parts

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.759
make the picture.

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:53.119
And my mum was always a great judge.

00:20:53.119 --> 00:21:01.079
Oh!

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.319
"Mum, what do you think of my painting?"

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:09.720
She would say...

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.359
"Very nice, dear. I like the frame better."

00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.799
In 2018, Timmy went on

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.720
a 2500-mile painting and biking trip around Europe.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.160
It is a long way to Santiago!

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.799
His brother Martin gave him the idea.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:18.839
Martin had Down's Syndrome.

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:22.559
He died just before Timmy left.

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:26.480
Martin was not stopped by his problems with talking and learning.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:34.440
He was never held back by Down's Syndrome.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.400
He would say, "You and me, I'm happy."

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.319
That means enjoy the moment right now.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.960
It is easy to enjoy the moment on the bike.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.759
Dear Martin shows me that,

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:47.079
give it a try,

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:50.240
try your best to do as much as you can.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.680
See if you can. Every day.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.000
Wonderful. What a great attitude.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And you know what, Adebanji? I'm finished.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.079
All right, I will come and see yours first.

00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:01.720
Oh, wow. I love it.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.799
The difference in the light hitting these posts.

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:05.960
You have these dark shapes against the sky,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.640
and then, boom, the light comes out.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.039
Wonderful. Brilliant.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.480
Thanks.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.160
Brilliant.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.839
Shall we look at yours?

00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:16.519
OK. Right.

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.799
I know that guy.

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.880
Yeah.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.880
There is some colour in this, right?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.359
Yeah.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.160
It shows what you do, how you do it, and what you use. Thank

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:43.119
you, that is really, really great. Thank you.

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:51.039
great. Thank you. Both paintings are so lovely. I used to love

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:55.160
watching Timmy Mallett.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.079
Time to say hello to our next guests.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:02.599
They are two actors who are also related.

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:08.920
It's Dame Imelda Staunton and her daughter Bessie Carter.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.039
I am with famous actors, because you just won

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:20.680
your fifth Olivier Award! Amazing! How do you feel? Greedy! Still

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:27.480
greedy. It is very nice, yes. You will not get much more from

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:37.400
me on that. You two are now mother and daughter on stage

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.440
in Mrs Warren's Profession. It is set in

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.079
old times. When it was first written, it is about the difficult relationship

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:49.039
between them. Then a secret comes out

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:56.079
that changes things.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.200
Yes, it is about a mother and daughter who have

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.920
been apart and have not known each other because of how things

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.200
were. We meet them over a few days when they have a kind

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.599
of argument that neither of them wants but

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:19.680
they must have. And to have a play written in 1893, about

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.119
the problems of women at work or at home or just in

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:28.240
life, that women again are not treated the same. George Bernard

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.039
Shaw strongly supported women. This play was banned because

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:36.359
they did not want to know. It was partly banned because of the name.

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:48.720
A woman having a title was not allowed. Not cool then.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.119
Now, you act with your mum, Bessie. This is your first time

00:24:53.119 --> 00:25:00.799
acting with her. How does it feel? Terrible, awful! We are both

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:08.000
having a terrible time!

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:10.359
It is really great. It is a real treat. We are

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:17.079
having a lovely time. It feels strangely normal to us.

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:22.680
We are just two actors in a room trying to tell a story.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.880
So it is a real treat. And the packed lunches are really good. That

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.359
is all we talk about! You have the hard-boiled eggs for the 11 o'clock

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:45.079
break, and then we compare food. Living the dream! And your dad is an

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:48.720
actor. You have directed him before. Is it good working with family,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.599
or not so much? When you get to that place where you are on the

00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:57.680
floor, working together, the relationship, the father and son

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.680
with my father, you trust each other. I will give him a suggestion, and

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.400
he would say OK and get up and do it. But it was a great thing for him

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.440
to let me direct. It is a great short film, and he is wonderful in it. I

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.799
am really glad I did that. I have something real

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:21.200
with my father that I can look at and show his

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.440
grandchildren later on. It was a great experience. Really

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.279
special, isn't it? And you said you had not acted together

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:34.279
before, but then we found this photo. We wondered what was

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:45.680
going on. This was a performance of Mamma Mia!!. It was last week!

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.839
Started young.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.279
Started young.

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:59.119
Talking family, Edison, what did your family say when you wanted to become an actor? My

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:03.880
parents always supported me but were careful.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.640
They told me, OK, good, have a Plan B, C, and D, and get a

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:17.880
degree. Did you? I did. I studied here in the UK, at

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.880
university, but I studied film making. It was a way to please my parents

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.200
but also still be involved somehow in

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:35.359
film. They must be proud now, though. I understand that.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:43.599
And lots of talk going around about the celebrity Traitors show.

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:47.240
Celia Imrie might be one of them. Will she

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.680
make a good Traitor? She is an actress. I bet she will make a

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.640
great Traitor. I cannot think of anyone better. We watch Traitors and

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.680
it is very funny. I think she would be a great addition to that

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.559
house.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.759
Mrs Warren's Profession opens on May 22nd at the Garrick

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:17.759
Theatre in London and runs until August 16th.

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:23.519
August 16th. -- Mrs Warren's Profession. This would surely

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:29.359
make the cast nervous!

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.519
A big thank you to all our guests

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:35.079
and to Matthew Bostock.

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.599
That is all the time we have tonight.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:40.039
I will be back tomorrow with Roman. We will be joined

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:41.920
by the stars of Thunderbolts, Florence Pugh and

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.119
Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Jeremy Vine.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:45.519
Plus, KSI gives out a special One Big Thank You.

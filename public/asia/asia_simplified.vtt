00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.760
Of all the wonderful places in the world, one.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.080
more riches than any other.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.040
It covers almost a third of the land on Earth.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.720
In the south, stand vast forests.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520
And to the north...

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.760
..lies an immense frozen wilderness.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.320
Much of the centre is dominated by.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.400
And at its heart are the world's highest mountains.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.440
Off the coast of this continent,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.920
stretch the richest seas on Earth.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.040
And that's not all.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.360
This is the most populous place on the planet.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.160
Here, animals live alongside humans.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.240
If you think you've seen the best the natural world has to offer,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.840
think again.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.200
There's nowhere else on Earth with so many untold stories.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.320
Welcome then, to Asia.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.400
Asia is the largest continent.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960
With a coastline over 100,000 miles long,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.080
it's surrounded by three oceans and 21 seas.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.960
Its waters stretch from Arabia, through the.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.800
and Southeast Asia, to the edge of the Pacific.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.600
Connected by some of the world's most powerful.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.440
..these seas are the richest on the planet.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.960
And the animals in Asia's oceans are as.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.280
In the warm waters of the Western.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.800
lives a dramatic little fish, with pouting lips and.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.960
..the flamboyant Moorish idol.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.240
This one is looking for a partner.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.080
Moorish idols normally breed in.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.480
But here, they do something that no others of their species do.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.360
They congregate in huge numbers...

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.800
..before swimming away from the reef, to spawn.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.720
But so many fish attract.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600
A grey reef shark...

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.600
..and it's not alone.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.680
With so many hiding places, there is.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.040
..but they must get out past the sharks.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.320
Finally, they make a break for it.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.400
Now in open water, they can swim into the blue.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.040
But they've been spotted.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.920
A few sharks can be avoided...

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.160
..but hundreds are a different.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.400
To have any chance of survival, they must stay in a tight group.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.520
The sharks try to split them up...

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.920
..and pick them off.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.400
After two hours of chasing,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.520
only the strongest are left.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.840
The few survivors swim in tight spirals,.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.520
The sharks, tired and full,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.200
one-by-one, abandon the chase...

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.160
..until only the luckiest and.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.400
No-one knows exactly where they spawn.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.640
But the developing young are.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.720
From the Western Pacific, comes one of the most.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.960
currents in the world - the.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.160
It sweeps between Borneo and.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.000
the Flores Sea, where it hits.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.320
Here, water is forced between the islands at a rate

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.680
of 15 billion litres a second.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.800
And this produces some of the world's most intense currents...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.200
..and whirlpools.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.000
Off the island of Komodo,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.360
the water is funnelled into.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.320
which concentrate the plankton it.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.960
..providing food...

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.200
..for giants.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.600
Manta rays.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.200
With a wingspan of up to five metres,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.040
these mantas exploit the powerful.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.040
They feed by filtering plankton from the.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.680
Such a feast makes this an excellent place to produce young.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.680
When the adults need a break, they head off for a bit of pampering.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.080
Out of the main flow are cleaning stations,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.560
staffed by hundreds of butterfly.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.600
The cleaners remove parasites and.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.080
and get a meal in exchange for their services.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.040
And the mantas get a welcome break from the ripping currents.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.920
Refreshed, they can go back to feeding.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.320
As the Indonesian Throughflow continues,.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.640
past Bali, to Java and some of the richest

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.120
coastal forests on Earth...

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.280
..mangroves.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.120
These are places where nothing is as you might expect.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.480
Trees grow in the sea...

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.320
..and fish live on land.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.200
A dusky-gilled mudskipper...

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.840
..only five centimetres long,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.720
but a master of these swamps.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.800
As long as they can stay wet, they can absorb oxygen from the air,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.840
and they spend most of their life out of water.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.080
Joints in their pectoral fins enable them to walk...

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.440
..and they can leap with a flick of their tail.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.400
This one is seeking a mate with whom to start a family.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.160
But first, he needs to dig a breeding burrow.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.080
Mudskippers will shift up to 300 times their body weight in mud,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.160
one mouthful at a time.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.720
Tiring work!

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.520
With the dirty job done,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.600
it's time to find a female.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.280
But the mangroves are full of.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.760
A special set of grasping belly fins,.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.120
enable skippers to become climbers.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.440
And when there is a dead end...

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.320
..a mudskipper simply skips across.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.960
a metre at a time.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.080
What's this?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.800
An open arena...

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.720
..full of females.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.240
Excellent!

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.760
But there are also other males here looking for.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.480
To win a female, they must duel.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.840
But no-one is backing down.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.480
Victory and the opponent beats.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.000
And it looks like this male...

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.480
..has caught someone's eye.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.080
A quick wave should seal the deal.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.120
It's a date.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.480
They head back to his place...

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.640
..ready to start a family of their own.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.560
Mangrove forests are essential for.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.120
And trap four times more carbon than forests growing on dry land.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.720
Today, Southeast Asia holds a third of what is left of these

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.280
precious forests...

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.800
..adding clean, fresh water to the.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.280
as it travels.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.400
Sweeping away from Indonesia,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.040
the current heads west across the vast Indian Ocean...

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.680
..carrying with it a whole host of drifters.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.160
And some objects provide entertainment

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.960
for one of Asia's giants.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.440
A baby sperm whale plays with a mangrove seed,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.120
so practising his coordination.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.920
He produces pulses of high.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.720
sonar that will eventually enable.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.560
in the black depths...

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.600
..and zeroing in on a tiny seed is great practice for doing so.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.920
When you're as big as this,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.440
grabbing something the size of a pencil is not.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.160
With play over, it's time to get back to the family.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.320
The grown-ups are taking a nap.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.160
It's thought that the reason they sleep upright is to make it

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.400
easy to bob up for air.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.360
The calf is keen to join in.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.240
But it's not as easy as it looks.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.440
Staying vertical takes practice.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.800
And when you get the hang of that,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.000
the next challenge is buoyancy.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.480
Holding just the right amount of breath is an art.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.440
Too little and you sink.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.480
The adults tenderly correct his.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.000
He still has a lot to learn.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.960
In his 70-year lifespan,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.080
he will explore much of the Indian Ocean.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.880
From here, the Indonesian Throughflow.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.000
..but a very different kind of.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.040
Shipping.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.120
Major international cargo-lanes run from.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.760
into the Red Sea, which divides.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.480
At its Northern end is the Suez Canal.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.280
One third of the world's container freight travels along it

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.240
and emerges into the Mediterranean...

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.920
..one of the planet's most polluted seas.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.680
Here, on Asia's westernmost coastline,

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.760
this Israeli power station discharges.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.600
than the surrounding sea.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.000
Astonishingly, this has become a.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.960
vulnerable of species...

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.680
..dusky sharks.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.600
Mediterranean sharks are the most.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.840
But up to 100 females come here in winter...

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.840
..and each one of them is pregnant.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.160
It's thought the warmth speeds up

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.560
the development of their unborn.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.720
This power station has created a shark.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.520
But elsewhere in Asia,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.640
deliberate steps are being taken.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.600
Over 5,000 miles away on the other side of the.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.560
..life is booming in the.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.360
..the tiny island of Tyuleniy,.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.760
..a disused hunting settlement.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.840
Here, enormous numbers of fur seals were once killed

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.960
annually for their skins.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.640
But hunting restrictions have produced.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.440
Over 100,000 Northern fur seals now come here each summer.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.400
It's one of the largest colonies in the world.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.280
The beaches are jam-packed.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.600
BLEATS LOUDLY

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.760
Huge, territorial males compete for.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.600
It's dangerous for the tiny pups,

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.840
which weigh just a 50th of the adult bulls.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.760
The aggressive males are only.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.520
When fights break out, the pups are ignored.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.720
In the aftermath, many pups lie.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.840
Life on the beach is full of danger...

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.320
..but it's no safer in the sea.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.040
Orca.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.520
Fur seals returning from fishing must run the gauntlet.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.760
But these orca are specialists...

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.720
..ramming and tail-slapping to stun their prey.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.920
And when their victim has been disabled...

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720
..they drown it.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.720
Many pups are left as orphans...

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.560
..but enough will survive to support this now healthy

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.720
population of Northern fur seals.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.040
This richness in Asia's shallow seas can also be

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.120
found in some of its deepest waters.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.680
Every night, billions of creatures.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.880
It's the largest regular movement.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.080
Strange life-forms come up to feed in the surface waters...

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.240
..among them jelly-like salps, which have tiny.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.000
living inside their bodies.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.320
As dawn arrives, they return to the.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.160
But some creatures, gathering in.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.760
to embark on a one-way trip out of the depths, never to return.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.680
Firefly squid.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.200
They live for just 12 months.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.960
It's thought that they use their blue bio-luminescent lights

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.440
to confuse predators...

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.360
..and their green lights to communicate with one.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.240
No other deep-sea animal can see green.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.400
It's the squids' own secret code.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.760
Some quarter of a billion.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.080
In the shallows, they lay thousands of eggs in strings...

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.520
..the final act of their short lives.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.320
With this done, their bodies are programmed to die.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.400
Here, on the north coast of Japan,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.160
they wash up on the beaches of Toyama Bay.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.720
Their lights fade, as life drifts away.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.440
Their eggs, however...

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.520
..are beginning to hatch.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.200
Sinking into the vast darkness of the deep sea,

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.760
they won't return to shallow water for a year,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.640
when it will be their turn to lay eggs and then die.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.400
2,000 miles south, in the western Pacific, lie wide

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.920
expanses of shallow seas around.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.440
Malaysia and Indonesia...

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.400
..the so-called Coral Triangle.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.040
Here, there are more abundant coral reefs than.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.400
It's the richest concentration of.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.600
Three-quarters of the world's coral species are found here...

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.200
..and over 3,000 species of fish.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.960
It's every bit as diverse as the.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.440
Coral reefs truly are the ocean's.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.040
Many residents have evolved ingenious.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.240
the problems of living in such close quarters.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.840
But some appear to be.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.080
Meet the sea bunny.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.720
Just a few centimetres long,

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.560
this tiny sea slug has no shell for protection...

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.320
..no eyes to spot danger...

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.880
..and travels at a snail's pace.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.440
It's looking for food.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.360
What appear to be its ears are, in fact, finely-tuned.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.840
that enable it to "smell" its way to its next meal.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.720
But on the reef, predators are.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.360
When you can't see...

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.360
..it can be hard to avoid trouble.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.800
Alien-like beasts patrol the nooks and crannies of the reef.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.120
This one filters its food from the water...

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.920
..and is no threat to the sea bunny.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.320
But not everything here is quite so.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.280
The Moray eel, powerful and fast...

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.880
..but apparently not keen on slug for.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.400
A scorpionfish, one of the reef's most deadly.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.400
Extravagantly camouflaged, it waits for.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.040
..then swallows them whole.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.520
But the sea bunny just walks all over him.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.840
And now, it's headed straight for a deadly-poisonous blue sponge.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.000
Blind and hungry, it's about to take a bite.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.320
It seems that its luck has finally run out.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.320
But, no, this is actually its.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.280
It's immune to the poison...

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.080
..and by eating the sponge,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.720
the sea bunny has made itself toxic to.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.560
No wonder it's untouchable.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.560
As long as it can maintain its blue sponge diet,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.600
the sea bunny will be protected.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.400
With so many complex survival.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.280
..life for predators on the coral triangle

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.400
can require complex tactics.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.120
This snake, a black-banded sea krait,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.640
has venom ten times stronger than a.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:39.200
..a forked tongue that enables it to sniff out prey.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.400
..and a flexible body,

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.320
so it can squeeze into crevices on the reef to look for prey.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.640
A formidable killer, it would seem.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.200
Yet, hunting fast prey is not one of its abilities.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.160
It's slow with poor eyesight, hardly the deadliest of.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.280
If only it were fast and agile...

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.520
..like these bluefin trevally.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.400
They rely on sheer speed to catch their prey.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.800
Unlike the snake,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.920
they are too big to get between the arms of the coral.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.560
But these two struggling species have found a solution.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.080
They work as a team.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.120
The trevally leads...

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.160
..indicating places where prey could.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.120
..which the snake then investigates.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.440
As they roam the reef, they're joined by more trevally...

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.320
..and more snakes.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.640
Soon, they are an army.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.640
The trevally find a target.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.920
The snakes head in...

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.080
..and the trevally cover the.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.760
There's nowhere left to hide.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.240
The trevally catch the fish that are flushed out...

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.840
..and the snake eats anything left inside.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.800
Each species benefits from the.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.680
The hunts are so successful that they attract

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.040
hundreds of trevally and snakes.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.400
This behaviour is extremely rare,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.120
and has only been seen in Asia's coral triangle.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.680
Innovation and teamwork are critical.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.440
in these competitive waters.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.000
These relationships and strategies developed.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.840
are a consequence of the.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.400
Asia's seas.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.920
And whilst our influence is now not far away,

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.200
Asia's oceans still remain a world of wonder,

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.480
offering spectacles not found anywhere.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.880
The Asia team explored many.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.960
They spent thousands of hours.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.040
filming the spectacular diversity of.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.040
But their biggest challenge was getting up close with

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.640
some of the most powerful currents on earth.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.720
The Indonesian Throughflow carries ten.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.760
the world's rivers combined.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:10.320
The tide has to make its way from the Pacific to the Indian,

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.200
and that's a huge amount of water.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.280
And as it does that,

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.600
it gets squeezed through these islands, which

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.800
creates intense currents, but also.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.480
The team want to capture this immense power up close...

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.600
..but the fast currents are making filming.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.600
For their first attempt, they use a pole-mounted camera.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.440
But getting the boat into.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.040
We're fighting a losing battle. Yeah. We'll drop it.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.680
Let's go back to the main boat.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.160
David thinks he has a solution, but it's.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.800
He's going to get in the water himself,

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.400
using a floating camera rig.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.280
We'll see the swirling water,.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.400
funnel of the whirlpool, that's what I want, it's like the epic shot.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.960
If the shot works, it's going to be amazing.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.880
It's going to really tell the story of the currents.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.520
So, I think what we have to do is put David up current,.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.280
but close-ish in to the island,

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.120
to get those swirls, as you come past.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.000
What's the normal advice for divers here?

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.240
Normally, we'll actually jump right next to the.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.040
They stay out of the current entirely...  Yes.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.040
..which is the opposite to what you're going to be doing!  Yes. OK, yeah.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.360
This challenge is unlike anything.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.280
in 30 years of film-making.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.240
I'm going to add two life jackets to the camera rig, and you know

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.280
if I start to get sucked down I'm going to just hang on to that.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.680
The key to staying safe will be buoyancy.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.560
Yeah, I don't know if I can get this third one on.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.440
Three life jackets should resist the pull of the whirlpools.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.600
It's not that bad.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.680
What do you think? Money?  Yeah.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.080
The team decide to dive on the rising tide

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.720
when the currents are weaker.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.360
I think I'm plenty floaty!

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.000
David's home-made protection is holding up well.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.720
The current is running fast, but the whirlpools aren't.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.280
David, nothing?  Nothing.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.720
Nothing at all?  Like, I... I feel the current, and I, like, I don't

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:04.200
see any, like, whirlpools, bubbles,.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.200
Do you want picking up?

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.680
Yeah.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.000
It seems that if David is to get his shots...

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.120
..he will have to brave the much faster falling tide.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.440
Preparation will be key to.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.360
Whirlpools only last a few seconds,

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.360
so to get in the right position, the team needs eyes in the sky.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.440
Drone's in the air.

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.640
OK, copy, copy. What do you guys see?

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.680
The current looks strong on that eastern edge of the island.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.560
If you can spot good places where the whirlpools are cropping up...

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.480
Mark, Mark, the swirl's forming on the edge you're at.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.080
Right, thanks, mate.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.240
Look, we've got some, definitely.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.040
David must get to the whirlpools before they.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.040
Is this a good spot? Yeah, I call it right here.

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.320
OK, clear to go.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.040
You're going to get sucked in pretty quickly.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.880
Behind you, David.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.200
Mark is ready with a throw rope, in case of trouble.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.520
You OK?

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.600
Do you want the rope?

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.760
He's OK.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.200
He wants to carry on.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.120
David's commitment is paying off.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.840
He's starting to get the shots.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.240
But the whirlpools are growing stronger.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.280
That is putting him right in the whirlpool zone.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.600
He's getting sucked in.

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.360
All he can do now is hang on.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.360
OK, can we get closer to David?

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.960
Whoa!

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.120
At last, the whirlpool spits him out.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.040
David, you OK?

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.440
Yeah.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.200
It's hairy. It's not doing anything for my nerves, let alone David's.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.120
It's time to get back into the safety of the boat.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.560
OK?  Yeah.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.010
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE
WITH GENIUS IQS LIVING IN CHINA

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.140
THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE OF ANY KIND
LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
- THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE.
- IT IS.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.140
WHAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT?

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
WELL, FIRST, AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE
LIVE IN CHINA, BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.440
HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH YOURSELF
IN A POPULATION OF PEOPLE

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360
WHO ALL GOT 1600 ON THEIR SATS?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.240
- I DIDN'T KNOW THEY TAKE SATS IN CHINA.
- THEY DON'T.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.450
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT CHINA ANYMORE,
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.990
YOU GOT A 1600?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.910
YES. I COULD SING IN AN A CAPELLA GROUP,
BUT I CAN'T SING.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.200
DOES THAT MEAN YOU ACTUALLY
GOT NOTHING WRONG?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.580
I COULD ROW CREW OR INVENT A $25 PC.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.910
OR YOU COULD GET INTO A FINAL CLUB.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.330
OR I GET INTO A FINAL CLUB.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.830
YOU KNOW, FROM A WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.790
SOMETIMES NOT SINGING IN
AN A CAPELLA GROUP IS A GOOD THING.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.920
THIS IS SERIOUS.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.460
ON THE OTHER HAND,
I DO LIKE GUYS WHO ROW CREW.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.420
WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.090
I WAS KIDDING.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.340
AND, YES, I GOT NOTHING WRONG ON THE TEST.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.220
- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED?
- I'M TRYING RIGHT NOW.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.140
- TO ROW CREW?
- TO GET INTO A FINAL CLUB.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470
TO ROW CREW? NO.
ARE YOU, LIKE, WHATEVER, DELUSIONAL?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.520
MAYBE IT'S JUST SOMETIMES
YOU SAY TWO THINGS AT ONCE.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.140
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AIMING AT.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.150
BUT YOU'VE SEEN GUYS WHO ROW CREW, RIGHT?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.270
NO.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.440
OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE BIGGER THAN ME.
THEY'RE WORLD-CLASS ATHLETES.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.980
AND A SECOND AGO,
YOU SAID YOU LIKE GUYS WHO ROW CREW

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.110
SO I ASSUMED YOU HAD MET ONE.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.200
I GUESS I JUST MEANT I LIKE THE IDEA OF IT.
YOU KNOW, THE WAY A GIRL LIKES COWBOYS.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.780
OKAY.

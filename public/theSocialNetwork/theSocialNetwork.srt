1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,010
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,140
than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,020
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,140
What would account for that?

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,230
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,440
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,360
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,450
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,990
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,910
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,200
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,580
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,910
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,330
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,830
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,790
sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,460
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,420
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,090
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,340
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,220
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,140
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,470
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,520
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,140
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,270
No.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,980
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,110
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,200
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,780
Okay.

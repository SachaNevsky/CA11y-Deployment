00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.010
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.140
than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.140
What would account for that?

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.440
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.450
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.990
You got a 1600?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.910
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.200
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.580
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.910
Or you could get into a final club.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.330
Or I get into a final club.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.830
You know, from a woman's perspective,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.790
sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.920
This is serious.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.460
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.420
Well, I can't do that.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.090
I was kidding.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.340
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.220
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.140
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.520
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.140
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.270
No.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.440
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.980
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.110
so I assumed you had met one.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.200
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.780
Okay.

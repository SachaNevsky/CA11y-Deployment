00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.354
I don't know, Nick.
You're the one who counts the money.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.795
These books...
Yes, I know.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.598
Hello?
I am not sure.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.752
Hello! Excuse me!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.195
I just want to know if... Hel...

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.999
It will be new this time.
Really.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.230
The money papers are all set.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.869
OK. I will see you in one hour. OK. Bye.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.269
Now...
How much for those books?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.669
Hm?
The books with leather covers.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.479
All the books by Charles Dickens.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.030
Is the leather real?
They are real Dickens books.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.999
I need to know. They must match my sofa.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.834
All other things in my house are real.
I will give you 200.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.154
Are they pounds made of leather?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.709
No.
They will not match my wallet.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.472
Next!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.998
Hello!
Hello.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.117
I need The Little Book of Calm.
Do you have it?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.078
I am late for work.
Uh, Calm...

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.276
Um, is this it?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.828
No, no, it is just...
Too big, too big.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.592
Little... just little...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.717
This one, this?
No! No, calm.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.234
The Little Book of Calm.
Um, this?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.992
That is it! Yes!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.957
Two-fifty.
Two-fifty...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.634
Could...
I will just get you a bag.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.915
No, no - no bag, just the book!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.992
I will make you a receipt.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.949
No, that is fine! 
It is broken. I will write one. Little...

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.715
I will do it!
Calm, two-fifty. Thank you.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.553
(Talking very fast and low)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.070
"Let go sometimes,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.436
"you are a free lily
floating down a yellow river."

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.392
(Sighs)

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.596
Sorry. I do not like my job.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.476
What a funny man.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.912
OK, the shop is closed!
Everyone leave!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.788
Time to go home! Come on!
It is only a bit before three.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.838
Yes, but it is my shop!
Come on, go home! Bye-bye!

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.469
That is not fair.
It is not fair at all. Get out!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.155
I want better help...
Want all you like. Bye-bye!

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.153
Come on, you people wasting my time!
Go back to the streets!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.199
Goodbye! Thank you! Bye-bye-bye!
Back to real life. Thank you!

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.115
(Machine knocking sound)

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.713
Bernard, do you want this?
What is it?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.916
It is a thing.
Is it?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.594
Yes.
What does it do?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.478
It is very new.
You do not know, do you?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710
It is very cool now.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.076
Will you watch the shop?
I need to see my money man.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.233
Will you get someone to help
so I do not have to keep doing this?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.472
OK, but you have to do it
for me in two days.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.198
OK. Why?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.157
You know Julie?
Yes.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.515
They are making the baby come out and...

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.034
she asked me to be there when the baby is born.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.473
Ugh.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.711
There will be lots
of blood and yelling and...

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.916
No, I will just get drunk.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.879
She will be on medicine,
I will be drunk...

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.190
it will be like old times.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.874
OK, have fun. Bye.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.032
Hello?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.475
I do sell a lot of silly things, do I not?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.594
So, show me your new way of keeping papers,
Bernard.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.511
This is March...

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.388
...to, um... Silly-name.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.755
This is... Other stuff...

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.470
And-and-and the rest are,
um... Other.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.711
Other what?
Other old weeks, is it?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.792
No. Other...

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.279
times.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.830
So it is This Week,
Very New, and...

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.478
All Other Times.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.553
Help me, Bernard,
what does All Other Times mean?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.835
I do not know, Nick!

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.917
I am not...
Wonder Woman.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.357
This new way is a lot like
the old way, is it not?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.508
I would say more.
I would say it is just the same.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.953
But...

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.832
No, it is the same.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.798
I just kind of lied
on the phone, Nick. I lied.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.313
Well...

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.756
(Did you hear that?)
What? What?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.479
Oh, nothing.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.437
You are lucky I am so...
nice.
Other money men might...

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.839
(Phone)

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.472
Hello? Yes, Jane. Oh, OK.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.590
OK, yes, mm-hm.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.636
(Machine sound)

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.712
I just have to go for a bit.
What, now?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.109
Yes, see you soon, OK? Bye.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.750
He is always one step more quick!

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.990
The cat is out of the basket!
The cat is out of the basket!

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.957
(Sirens)

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.993
Mmm.
Yes, it is going fast.
I am on it.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.675
It will be in the pipe soon.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.792
The best thing is if I...
You...

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.112
Manny... What are you eating?
Soup?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.270
Yes.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.313
It has big bits in it.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.312
What is in it?!
Big bits.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.431
Should I be doing a job?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.069
I have the Gleason money papers -
I would have e-mailed them

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.836
but I had a... a lot of stuff on...
the thing... that makes things bigger,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.469
and, um... the plug went in some drink.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.233
Look, just do better
or leave, OK?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.275
(Phone)

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.075
Eh? Hi, yes.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.991
Yes.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.232
(Hard to hear)
Yes, I am looking for the, um...

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.276
...the work money papers.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.276
"Think of the ocean."

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.636
(Yelling)

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.236
Oh, a calm sea, right.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.149
Right, we need to put
Friday's bills in.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.595
OK, yes.
Here I come.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.755
(Choking)
What is it?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.753
(Choking)
It is my Little Book of Calm...

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.593
I have swallowed
my Little Book of Calm!

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.955
(Siren sound)

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.555
Is it a kind of bald fluffy toy?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.390
Bernard! Closing early? How did it go?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.235
Nick the money man...
Nick the money man... is running away!

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.314
I am not doing my money papers!
Why?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.231
You can stick it up your bum!

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.757
Bernard, you will have
to do them by yourself. It is easy.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.990
Yes, give it... give it a try.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.594
I am sure I could sort of do it.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.035
WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.277
THE WHAT?!

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.388
"If you live in a town flat
by a river but are not blind..."

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.833
WHAT?!

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.275
"What is your mother's family name?"

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.316
What is her first name?!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.597
I just knew her as Ma!
Ma - that will have to be it.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.113
Ma.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.310
Maybe she is dead.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.837
"Did the money you spent and can't get back
for the first half of the year

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.469
"go over what you took off
for your tax money back?"

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.835
Right, all my socks are in pairs.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.717
Back to the money papers.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.552
OK.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.594
"Did the money you spent and can't get back
for the first half of the year

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.958
"go over what you took off
for your tax money back?"

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.629
Hello, Ma? It is Bernard.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.472
No, nothing is bad.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.791
I do not need a reason
to call my mother, do I?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.236
I know, I am, yes.
I know.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.276
Yes. Yes. I will.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.351
I know. Ha. Yes.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.237
Yes! I know.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.914
Yes. OK.
Goodbye, I have to do my tax!

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.398
"Did your money spent
that you can't get back..."

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.835
(Knock at door)
Thank God!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.353
Yes?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.670
Could we talk to you about Jesus?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.670
Great! Come in!

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.793
What?
I would love to hear about Jesus!

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.632
Come on in!

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.393
Um, are you sure?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.152
Yes! In, in! Come in! It is a trick!

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.710
It is just... most times
people do not say yes.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.190
I am not people -
come on in, let us talk about what we believe!

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.950
Come in, come in. Sit down.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.152
Right, let us go.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.359
Well... to be true
we have never really...

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.670
thought this much before.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.633
It is, uh, it is nice in here.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.756
Inside.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.231
What is your best story
about, um... Our Lord?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.396
Money men,
it has to be the money men.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.189
Chasing them out of the church.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.157
It is great stuff.
And you?

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.074
Well, it is all good. I guess when he saved... when Jesus saved the Samaritan.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.037
No, that is a story Jesus tells

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.759
about the Samaritan
who helps someone else.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.790
Really? Wow.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.316
I like the one where he went
to eat with the tax man.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.632
And do you have any books
or... anything I could look at?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.954
Oh, yes!

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.837
Those books and papers!

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.797
(Both) Books and papers!

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.392
(Beeping)

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.910
Ah, there you are.
Time for my news?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.594
It is bad news, I am scared, Mr Bianco.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.636
The Little Book of Calm

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.792
is stuck between
your small gut and your pancreas.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.032
If it turns a little bit left,
you will be dead very fast.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.237
Oh, my God...
No, wait a bit.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.517
The other thing that could happen,
and this is more likely,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.831
is that the Little Book of Calm
will move into your kidney tube.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.310
If this happens, you could live
for maybe...

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.470
ten years, one year, who can tell?

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.599
But because of the big cuts
made by the book,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.673
you could be in lots of pain...
Oh, my... Sorry.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.876
...during that time
Oh, my God!

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.155
(Beeping)
Sorry, I have to go.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.117
We will cut you open tomorrow.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.351
There is a good chance
you will live - 30 out of 100 I would say -

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.476
so try not to feel bad.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.596
As the book itself says...

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.912
um, "When you are
in a hard spot,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.198
"try to think you are stuck
on a nice desert island."

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.790
So he said that because
no one is without bad things, right?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.792
Yes, that is what he...
But it was not clear.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.792
So it is like God and Jesus
are the same thing?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.030
Yes. Are you sure you will not stay?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.873
No, really, we have to go,
it is very late.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.757
OK, as you wish.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.991
Call again soon, yes?
Oh, yes, yes.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.076
Yes, yes...

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.792
Goodbye.
Yes, later.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.111
Bernard?
Done with your money papers?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.955
Yes. I have turned them
into a quite nice casual coat.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.912
Bernard!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.755
I mean, it is a very nice coat,
but what about your money papers?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.956
I do not know! Will you do them?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.433
Oh, you have got that wrong for
a start - you share by ten there.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.034
Oh - no, no, no,
I am not doing this.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.398
I have to give all my thoughts
to being with Julie when the baby comes.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.597
Oh! Look, look!
There is something on the side!

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.910
15.99. Oh, no, I wrote that.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.839
What am I going to do?
Who is going to help me?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.798
(Doctor) Mr Bianco,
back with us now.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.474
There has been a... problem.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.791
You see, we went in
to take out the book and, um...

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.430
Well, in doctor talk, it is gone.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.034
To say it a new way,
it is not there.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.190
I do not know how this happened.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.511
The only way to say it
is that you took it

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.114
into your body,
which cannot happen.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.198
How do you feel?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.874
Add a bit of lavender
to your bath,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.350
and soon,
you will make yourself calm.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.032
I am sorry?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.910
If you want to feel calm,
eat more fresh fruit and plants,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.878
yoghurt, milk and seeds.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.872
Um, maybe I should
let you get some sleep.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.635
When you rest, you are a king
looking at your land.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.792
Look at the trees,
the pretty birds on the grass.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.589
Be the king of your own calm land.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.195
Uh... Yes.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.396
I have got it!
I am doing them!

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.189
I know what this is -
it is for not eating sugar.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.589
Yes, that is just what it is not.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.035
No, that is silly, is it not?

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.079
What is this - blah blah
blah blah blah blah

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.833
yes yes blah blah...
"Rule for not doing it,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.629
"person who is hurt or sick
for a short or long time

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.676
"can wait to give their papers..."

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.437
Wait..."Person who is hurt or sick
for a short or long time

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.476
"can wait to give their papers..."

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.357
(Laughs)

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.911
No, no, stop it, Bernard. You would
have to really hurt yourself.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.390
You are not going to do that
just to not do money papers.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.719
This is on a special price.
Really?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.109
Yes, it is free if you break my legs.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.032
OK then.
Great!

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.511
I will get the post for breaking legs.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.034
Wait, I have read this. That is the bad thing with Wodehouse.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.917
Yes, now break my legs.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.230
But I have read it! No, I am sorry.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.399
What is this?! Do you know
what the heck this is?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.836
(Loudspeaker) 'Would the person helping
Julie Williams with her baby

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.718
'please go to delivery room one.'

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.756
(Singing) # Gloria!

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.317
Gloria!

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.356
(Woman yelling)

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.711
Where is my baby helper?!

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.758
I cannot do this
without my baby helper!

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.071
Where is she?!
Julie, we cannot find her.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.720
We have been calling her all day.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.918
When you feel lots of stress,
do something new.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.197
Roll up your shirt arms
or eat an orange.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.311
Gloria!

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.231
Gloria!

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.276
(Dog barking)

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.670
(Car alarm beeping)

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.676
(Alarm stops)

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.309
Is it a kind of pretend breast?

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.276
You know, that dads put on?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.354
What are you saying?
You know, for babies.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.998
Ba...

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.356
Babies. Oh, my God - Julie!

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.793
Oh!

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.354
Look for things
that make you laugh.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.194
If you see nothing to laugh at,
act like you see it, then laugh.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.998
(Talks low)

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.355
(Man) Oi!
Hairy!

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.192
What are you looking at?

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.909
Have you ever seen a calm
person with a loud voice?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.956
Try to speak soft sometimes.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.035
Add a bit of lavender to milk,
leave town with an orange

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.076
and act like you are laughing at it.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.430
Oi! You people, you better go,
I have to do a few...

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.990
I have to... Oh! Men with no hair!
Great!

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.990
Do you think you are funny?
What did I miss?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.640
Want another hit, do you?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.278
Another hit?

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.113
Which one of you girls
wants to dance?

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.519
Hey, when you are doing your normal
three person fun on a weekend

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.831
and the moon light is hitting off
your heads and bums,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.876
is that not hard to tell apart?

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.553
Right. Look, this is you, OK?

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.351
# Tra-la-la la-la
la-la la-la... #

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.110
Millwall, that is the team.
Do you know this song?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.510
Millwall, Millwall,
you are all very bad,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.592
and your girlfriends
are not happy and feel alone.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.999
(# Singing)

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.232
Hmm?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.398
Uhh?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.675
(Crying softly)

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.475
(Hitting softly)

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.358
Are you in pain?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.874
Not enough! Where did they go?!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.110
They got tired and left.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.430
Um, why... why did you do that?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.512
That was so great,
the way you just...

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.990
kept letting them
hit you and... Thank you.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.198
I am hurt, I do not have to do
my money papers. You saw it.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.238
(Knock at door)
I could do your money papers.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.153
What?
I am a money man. I used to be.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.119
It is the smallest thing I could do.
You mean you could do more?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.634
Yes.
Could I have a glass of wine?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.996
OK.
And a ham sandwich?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.514
If you want.
With pickle?

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.352
All right.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.118
(Both yell)

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.876
Right, you start on that

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.952
and I will start the...
work of the day.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.998
Car will not start.
Cab number, cab number.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.110
Got to get to Julie...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.472
(Screams)

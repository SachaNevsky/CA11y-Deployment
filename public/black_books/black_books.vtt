00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.354
I don't know, Nick.
You're the accountant.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.795
- These books...
- Yeah, I know.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.598
- Hello?
- I'm not sure.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.752
Hello, there! Excuse me!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.195
I just wonder if... Hel...

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.999
It'll be different this time.
Honestly.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.230
The accounts are in order.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.869
OK. I'll see you in an hour. OK. Bye.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.269
- Now...
- Those books, how much?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.669
- Hm?
- The leather-bound books.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.479
The Collected Works
of Charles Dickens.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.030
- They're real leather?
- They're real Dickens.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.999
I have to know because
they have to go with a sofa.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.834
Everything else in my house is real.
I'll give you 200.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.154
Are they leather-bound pounds?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.709
- No.
- They won't go with my wallet.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.472
Next!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.998
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.117
I need The Little Book of Calm,
do you have it?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.078
I'm late for work. Uh, Calm...

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.276
Er, is this it?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.828
No, no, it's just...
Too big, too big.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.592
Little... just little...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.717
- This one, this?
- No! No, calm.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.234
- The Little Book of Calm.
- Er, this?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.992
That's the one! Yes!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.957
- Two-fifty.
- Two-fifty...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.634
- Could...
- I'll just get you a bag.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.915
No, no - no bag, just the book!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.992
- I'll do you a receipt.
- No, that's fine!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.949
It's broken. I'll write one.
Little...

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.715
I'll do it!
Calm, two-fifty. Thank you.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.553
(Muttering frantically)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.070
"Let-let-let go once in a while,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.436
"you are a loose lily
floating down an amber river."

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.392
(Sighs)

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.596
Sorry. I hate my job.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.476
What a strange man.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.912
Right, the shop is closed!
Everybody get out!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.788
- Time to go home! Come on!
- It's only quarter to three.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.838
Yes, but it's my shop!
Come on, go home! Bye-bye!

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.469
- It's hardly fair.
- It's not fair at all. Get out!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.155
- I expect better service...
- Expect away. Bye-bye!

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.153
Come on, you time-wasting bastards!
Back on the streets!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.199
Goodbye! Thank you! Bye-bye-bye!
Back to reality. Thank you!

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.115
(Mechanical knocking)

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.713
- Bernard, do you want this?
- What is it?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.916
- It's a thing.
- Is it?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.594
- Yes.
- What does it do?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.478
- It's very in.
- You don't know, do you?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710
It's very now.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.076
Will you mind the shop?
I have to see my accountant.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.233
Will you get an assistant
so I don't have to keep doing this?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.472
OK, but you have to do the same
for me the day after tomorrow.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.198
OK. Why?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.157
- You know Julie?
- Yeah.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.515
They're inducing the baby and...

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.034
she's asked me to be birth partner.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.473
Ugh.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.711
There'll be a lot
of blood and shouting and...

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.916
No, I'll just get drunk.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.879
In fact, she'll be on drugs,
I'll be drunk...

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.190
it'll be just like the old days.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.874
OK, have a nice time. Bye.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.032
Hello?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.475
I do sell a lot of wank, don't I?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.594
So, show me your new filing system,
Bernard.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.511
This is March...

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.388
...to, er... Oobely-boo.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.755
This is... Misc...

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.470
And-and-and the rest are,
er... Other.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.711
Other what?
Other backdated weeks, is it?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.792
No. Other...

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.279
times.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.830
So it goes This Week,
Very Recent, and...

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.478
All Other Times.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.553
Help me out here, Bernard,
what does All Other Times cover?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.835
I don't know, Nick! I'm not...

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.917
Wonder Woman.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.357
This new system is closely modelled
on the old system, isn't it?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.508
I'd go further than that.
I'd say it was exactly the same.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.953
Except...

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.832
No, it's the same.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.798
I just sort of lied
on the phone, Nick. I lied.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.313
Well...

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.756
- (Did you hear that?)
- What? What?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.479
Oh, nothing. You're lucky I'm so...

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.437
accommodating.
Other accountants might...

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.839
(Phone)

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.472
Hello? Yes, Jane. Oh, right.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.590
OK, yeah, mm-hm.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.636
(Whirring)

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.712
- I've just got to pop off.
- What, now?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.109
Yeah, see you soon, all right? Bye.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.750
He's always one step ahead!
The cat has left the basket.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.990
The cat has left the basket!

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.957
(Sirens)

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.993
Mmm. Yeah, it's flying.
I'm right on it.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.675
It'll be in the pipe soon.
The best thing is if I...

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.792
You...

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.112
Manny... What's that you're eating?
Soup?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.270
Yes.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.313
It's extra-chunky.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.312
- What's in it?!
- Chunks.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.431
Should I be doing something?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.069
I have the Gleason accounts -
I would've e-mailed them

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.836
but I had a... a lot of clink on...
the stuffer... expander,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.469
and, er... plug went in some Tizer.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.233
Look, just shape up
or ship out, all right?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.275
(Phone)

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.075
Eh? Hi, yih.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.991
Yuh.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.232
(Muffled)
Yeah, I'm chasing up the, er...

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.276
...the company account.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.276
"Visualise the ocean."

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.636
(Yelling)

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.236
Oh, a calm ocean, right.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.149
Right, we've got to get
Friday's invoices in.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.595
OK, yeah. Here I come.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.755
- (Choking)
- What is it?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.753
(Choking)
It's my Little Book of Calm...

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.593
I've swallowed
my Little Book of Calm!

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.955
(Siren wailing)

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.555
Is it some kind of bald Furby?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.390
Bernard! Early closing? How'd it go?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.235
Nick the accountant...
Nick the accountant... is a fugitive!

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.314
- I'm not doing my accounts!
- Why?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.231
You can stick it up your arse!

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.757
Bernard, you'll have
to do them yourself. It's easy.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.990
Yeah, give it... give it a go.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.594
I'm sure I could muddle along.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.035
WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.277
THE WHAT?!

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.388
"If you live in a council flat
beside a river but are not blind..."

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.833
WHAT?!

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.275
"What is your mother's maiden name?"

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.316
What's her first name?!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.597
I just knew her as Ma!
Ma - that'll have to do.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.113
Ma.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.310
Possibly deceased.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.837
"Did your non-returnable outgoings
for the first half of the year

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.469
"exceed your deductions
for quarterly VAT returns?"

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.835
Right, that's all my socks paired.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.717
Back to the accounts.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.552
OK.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.594
"Did your non-returnable outgoings
for the first half of the year

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.958
"exceed your deductions
for quarterly VAT returns?"

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.629
Hello, Ma? It's Bernard.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.472
No, nothing's wrong.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.791
I don't need an excuse
to call my mother, do I?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.236
I know, I am, yeah. I know.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.276
Yes. Yes. I will.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.351
I know. Ha. Yes.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.237
Yes! I know.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.914
Yeah. OK.
Goodbye, I have to do my tax!

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.398
"Did your
non-returnable outgoings..."

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.835
- (Knock at door)
- Thank Christ!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.353
Yes?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.670
Could we talk to you about Jesus?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.670
Great! Come in!

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.793
- What?
- I'd love to hear about Jesus!

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.632
Come on in!

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.393
- Er, are you sure?
- Yes! In, in! Come in!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.152
It's a trick!

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.710
It's just... generally
people don't say yes.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.190
I'm not people -
come on in, let's talk beliefs!

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.950
Come in, come in. Grab a pew.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.152
Right, let's go.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.359
Well... to be honest
we've never actually...

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.670
thought this far ahead.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.633
It's, uh, it's nice in here.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.756
Indoors.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.231
What's your favourite story
about, er... Our Lord?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.396
Money lenders,
it has to be the money lenders.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.189
- Chasing them out of the temple.
- It is knock-out stuff.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.157
- And yourself?
- Well, it's all good.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.074
I suppose when he rescued...
when Jesus rescued the Samaritan.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.037
No, that's a story Jesus tells

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.759
about the Samaritan
who helps somebody else.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.790
Really? Wow.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.316
I like the one where he went
to dinner with the tax collector.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.632
And do you have any literature
or... anything I could look at?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.954
Oh, yes!

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.837
Those books and magazines!

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.797
(Both) Books and magazines!

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.392
(Beeping)

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.910
Ah, there you are.
Time for my results?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.594
It's bad news, I'm afraid, Mr Bianco.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.636
The Little Book of Calm

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.792
is lodged between
the small intestine and the pancreas.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.032
If it rotates a centimetre left,
you'll be dead in seconds.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.237
- Oh, my God...
- No, hold on a moment.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.517
The other possibility,
and this is more likely,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.831
is that the Little Book of Calm
will move into the renal canal.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.310
If this happens, you could live
for anything up to...

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.470
ten years, one year, who knows?

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.599
Because of the massive scarring
caused by the book, however,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.673
- you could be in great pain...
- Oh, my... Sorry.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.876
...during that time
- Oh, my God!

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.155
- (Beeping)
- Sorry, I have to go.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.117
We'll operate tomorrow.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.351
There's a good chance
you'll survive - 30% I'd say -

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.476
so try not to worry.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.596
As the book itself says...

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.912
um, "Whenever
you're in a tight spot,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.198
"try to imagine being marooned
on a beautiful desert island."

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.790
So he said that because
no one's without sin, right?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.792
Yeah, that's what he...
But it was hidden.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.792
So it's like God and Jesus
are the one thing?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.030
Yes. Are you sure you won't stay?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.873
No, really, we have to go,
it's very late.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.757
OK, whatever.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.991
- Call again though, yeah?
- Oh, yes, yes.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.076
Yeah, yeah...

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.792
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, later.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.111
Bernard?
Finished with your accounts?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.955
Yeah. I've turned them
into a rather smart casual jacket.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.912
Bernard!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.755
I mean, it is a very nice jacket,
but what about your accounts?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.956
I don't know! Will you do them?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.433
Oh, you've got that wrong for
a start - you divide by ten there.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.034
Oh - no, no, no,
I'm not doing this.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.398
I have to give all my attention
to being Julie's birth partner.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.597
Oh! Look, look!
There's something on the side!

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.910
15.99. Oh, no, I wrote that.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.839
What am I gonna do?
Who's gonna help me?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.798
(Doctor) Mr Bianco,
back with us at last.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.474
There's been a... complication.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.791
You see, we went in
to remove the book and, um...

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.430
Well, in medical terms, it's gone.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.034
To put it another way,
it's not there.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.190
I don't know how this happened.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.511
The only explanation
is that you assimilated it

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.114
into your system,
which is impossible.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.198
How do you feel?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.874
Add a drop of lavender
to your bath,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.350
and soon,
you will soak yourself calm.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.032
I'm sorry?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.910
If you want to feel calm,
eat more raw fruit and vegetables,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.878
yoghurt, milk and seeds.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.872
Er, maybe I should
let you get some rest.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.635
When you rest, you are a king
surveying your estate.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.792
Look at the woodland,
the peacocks on the lawn.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.589
Be the king of your own calm kingdom.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.195
Uh... Yes.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.396
- I've got it!
- I'm doing them!

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.189
I know what this is -
it's for giving up sugar.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.589
Yeah, that's exactly what it's not.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.035
No, that's absurd, isn't it?

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.079
What's this - blah blah
blah blah blah blah

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.833
yah yah blah blah...
"Exemption clause,

Wait..."Person suffering from short

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.357
(Laughs)

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.911
No, no, give it up, Bernard. You'd
have to really cripple yourself.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.390
You're hardly gonna do that
just to avoid doing accounts.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.719
- This is on special offer.
- Really?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.109
Yes, it's free if you break my legs.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.032
- Fair enough.
- Great!

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.511
- I'll get the hobbling post.
- Wait, I've read this.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.034
That's the problem with Wodehouse.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.917
Yes, now break my legs.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.230
But I've read it! No, I'm sorry.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.399
What is this?! Have you any idea
what the hell this is?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.836
(PA) 'Would the birth partner
of Julie Williams

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.718
'please report to delivery room one.'

(Woman yelling)

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.711
Where's my birth partner?!

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.758
I can't do this
without my birth partner!

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.071
- Where is she?!
- Julie, we can't find her.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.720
We've been calling her all day.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.918
When you're feeling under pressure,
do something different.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.197
Roll up your sleeves
or eat an orange.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.311

(Car alarm bleeping)

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.676
(Alarm stops)

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.309
Is it some kind of fake breast?

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.276
You know, that dads wear?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.354
- What are you talking about?
- You know, for babies.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.998
Ba...

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.356
Babies. Oh, my God - Julie!

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.793
Oh!

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.354
Be on the lookout
for things that make you laugh.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.194
If you see nothing worth laughing at,
pretend you see it, then laugh.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.998
(Mutters)

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.355
(Man) Oi! Hairy!

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.192
What you lookin' at?

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.909
Have you ever noticed a calm
person with a loud voice?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.956
Try and speak softly once in a while.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.035
Add a dab of lavender to milk,
leave town with an orange

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.076
and pretend you're laughing at it.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.430
Oi! You lot, you better clear off,
I have to do a few...

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.990
I have to... Oh! Skinheads! Perfect!

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.990
- Do you think you're funny?
- What happened?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.640
Looking for another slap, are ya?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.278
Another slap?

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.113
Which one of you bitches
wants to dance?

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.519
Hey, when you're doing the usual
sort of threesome of a weekend

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.831
and the moonlight's bouncing off
your heads and arses,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.876
is that not confusing?

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.553
Right. Look, this is you, OK?

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.351
# Tra-la-la la-la
la-la la-la... #

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.110
Millwall, that's the one.
Do you know this chant?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.510
Millwall, Millwall,
you're all really dreadful,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.592
and your girlfriends
are unfulfilled and alienated.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.999
(# Choir)

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.232
Hmm?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.398
Uhh?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.675
(Whimpering)

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.475
(Slapping gently)

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.358
Are you in pain?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.874
Not enough! Where have they gone?!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.110
They got tired and went away.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.430
Er, why... why did you do that?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.512
That was so incredible,
the way you just...

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.990
kept letting them
punch you and... Thank you.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.198
I'm injured, I don't have to do
my accounts. You're a witness.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.238
- (Knock at door)
- I could do your accounts.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.153
- What?
- I'm an accountant. I was.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.119
- It's the least I could do.
- You mean you could do more?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.634
- Yeah.
- Could I have a glass of wine?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.996
- OK.
- And a ham sandwich?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.514
- If you like.
- With pickle?

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.352
All right.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.118
(Both yell)

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.876
Right, you get started on that

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.952
and I'll begin the...
business of the day.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.998
Car won't start.
Cab number, cab number.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.110
Got to get to Julie...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.472
(Screams)
